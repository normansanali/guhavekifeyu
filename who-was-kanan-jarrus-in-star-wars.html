His master, Deppa Bilaba, admired his curiosity, though many other Jedi derided young Jarrus for his constant questions. The pair worked well together, and Jarrus held deep respect for his master, losing his temper quickly if she was disrespected. After he watched her die on planet Kaller during order 66, Dume was never the same.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Order 66</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Caleb-Dume-Depa-Bilaba-order-66.jpg><p data-characters=670 data-current-count=970 data-injectable=true>Dume was with his master when Palpatine’s Order 66 was given. Dume was tasked by his master to complete a mission with the legendary clone soldiers of The Bad Batch and as the group moved out, Dume heard the assault begin. His master told him to run, but Caleb could only stare on in horror as his master was murdered by her subordinates. Dume would eventually flee when the leader of the Bad Batch, Hunter, attempted to approach him. Hunter would be the reason Dume was ultimately able to escape the fate of so many Jedi; the clone would convince his fellows that the young Jedi had fallen to his death, giving the boy just enough time to get ahead of the clone army.</p><p data-characters=639 data-current-count=639 data-injectable=true>The young padawan escaped to a nearby city, where he fell in with smuggler Janus Kasmir. Determined to help his fellow Jedi, Dume stole Kasmir’s ship and headed for Coruscant. Before he could reach the planet, Obi-Wan Kenobi’s warning message came through and young Dume realized all was lost and returned to the smuggler who would teach him how to steal and survive in a violent universe. It was during his time with Kasmir that Caleb Dume would ultimately change his name to Kanan Jarrus and cut his padawan braid. Kanan stopped practicing his skills, uncertain with no master to teach him and unwilling to out himself to the Empire.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Joining the Rebels and Hera Sydulla</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Hera-Kanan-Star-Wars-Rebels.jpg><p data-characters=611 data-current-count=911 data-injectable=true>After years of living as an outlaw and drifting from planet to planet drinking his sorrows away, Kanan met already active Rebel Alliance member <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hera Syndulla</a>. The Twi’lek rebel caught his attention and the two seemed destined to run into one another. Eventually teaming up, the two quickly discovered their innate ability to work together. When a hitch in the job lead Kanan to reveal his Jedi abilities, Hera’s acceptance was enough to convince him the Force had meant for the pair to meet. Caving to the enigmatic pressure, Kanan asked Hera if he could join her motley crew on the ship known as the Ghost.</p><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true>Hera and Kanan would quickly realize their relationship could never be platonic. The duo fought their feelings, however, with at least Hera putting her duty as a Rebel over her personal life. Kanan was more frustrated with the secrecy of the relationship, but wouldn’t push Hera to acknowledge it until near the end of his part in the rebellion. While they many not have been married, Hera openly referred to Kanan as “Love” and the two would consistently yearn for one-on-one time.</p><p data-characters=719 data-current-count=719 data-injectable=true>Throughout it all, Hera’s steadfast nature and Kanan’s decisive will made the pair a powerful combination. Kanan assumed the role of captain of the Ghost and their splinter cell grew in size. The Lasat, Garazeb Orrelios, and the Mandalorian <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabine Wren</a> joined the team for a mission on the planet Lothal. Above all, Hera was dedicated to the rebellion, keeping her small rebel group unaware of the large movement they were apart of. Kanan was all too aware of the futility of fighting the empire, and the couple hid their feelings for one another so as to focus on their missions. It wasn’t until Kanan took an apprentice of his own that the rest of the crew would come to understand the breadth of the rebellion.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Life as a Jedi Master</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ezra-Kanan-star-wars.jpg><p data-characters=835 data-current-count=1135 data-injectable=true>Kanan would eventually reconnect with his Jedi heritage after meeting the force-sensitive orphan Ezra Bridger on Planet Lothal. &nbsp;Though he was unsure of his abilities to train an apprentice, Hera convinced Kanan to train Ezra after the orphan rescued most of the Ghost’s crew. With the death of his master as a Padawan, Kanan was unable to finish his Jedi training. The constant need to hide his abilities had never allowed him to hone the skill and he lacked faith in himself. His self-doubt combined with Ezra’s poor attitude caused plenty of strife in the early stages of their training. The duo would push through the growing pains and eventually find their stride as master and apprentice in a Jedi temple, a harrowing experience that tempered both of their expectations and led to a solid foundation between the two.</p><p data-characters=532 data-current-count=532 data-injectable=true>With trust established, the duo would go on to fight and kill (well, technically he falls to his death) the Grand Inquisitor. The pair would even survive an onslaught from multiple members of the Inquisitorious at once with the help of Darth Maul, but Maul’s desire to take Ezra as his own apprentice — and his generally unpleasant nature — prompts the Sith lord to try and kill Kanan. While he is unsuccessful in his attempted murder, he does strike Kanan across the face, blinding the rebel and shattering his sense of self.</p><p data-characters=883 data-current-count=883 data-injectable=true>The loss of his eyesight causes Kanan to temporarily lose his connection to the force. His weakened state leads him to neglect his duties as a master and team leader and his perceived weakness infuriates Ezra. Most of the crew is sympathetic, however, and leave Kanan to seek solace through meditation. During one of his sessions, he was able to feel a connection to a strange force-sensitive creature called Bendu. The being would realign Kanan and introduce him to the duality inherent in the force, enforcing the idea that light and dark cannot exist without one another and balance comes from the existence of both. His lesson leaves Kanan a far better Jedi and he is able to return to his crew more powerful than he was before Maul’s attack. Now a more competent teacher, Kanan continues to train Ezra and even mentors Sabine Wren when the Darksaber falls into her possession.</p><h2 id=h-death-and-spiritual-emergence data-injectable=false>Death and spiritual emergence</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Kanan-star-wars-rebels.jpg><p data-characters=739 data-current-count=1039 data-injectable=true>Kanan remains a loyal mentor and friend aboard the Ghost until his eventual death after the Empire’s siege on Lothal. After Hera’s capture, Kanan sets out to rescue her, leaving most of the crew behind. Before he reaches her prison, he is confronted by the vision of a white wolf, which mutters one word to him: “Dume”. The message is clear to Kanan and he goes on to rescue Hera. While the two are waiting for pick up, Hera tells him she loves him, and the two share a kiss. Before they can ride off into the sunset, enemy forces fire missiles at their location. With no other options and having accepted his death several hours before, Kanan holds back the explosion long enough for his friends to escape before being evaporated.</p><p data-characters=529 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>The destruction of his physical body doesn’t stop Kanan, however. The Jedi’s will returns in the shape of a giant wolf named Dume. It guides Ezra through dreams and in enigmatic appearances until he succeeds in stopping the destruction of a Jedi temple on Lothal. When Ahsoka Tano sees the beast, she assumes it is part of the Cosmic Force (similar to what Obi-wan and Yoda become upon their deaths). When the last of Kanan Jarrus’ will is fulfilled, Dume disappears into the desert, and Kanan presumably rejoins the Force.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Legacy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Star-Wars-Rebels-Hera-Jaycen-2.jpg><p data-characters=530 data-current-count=830 data-injectable=false>Kanan Jarrus was one of many Jedi that spoke to Rey During Rise of Skywalker. His presence in the Cosmic Force ties him to all force-sensitives to come. His influence on Erza Bridger cannot be understated; without Kanan, there is a good chance Ezra could have fallen to the Dark Side. While Hera and Kanan may not have had their picture-perfect romance, the two did love each other and conceived a boy before Kanan’s Death. Kanan’s son Jacen Syndulla has potential to be another Jedi, or at the very least an incredible pilot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5mrpqrXaCur63NZqGaqqKqwG61zWaqrZmiYsSivtJo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./you-dont-want-me-anymore-html.html>&#171;&nbsp; Steel Breeze You Don't Want Me An</a>
