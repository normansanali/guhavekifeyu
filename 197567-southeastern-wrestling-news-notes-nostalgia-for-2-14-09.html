It said that Muchnick and the NWA Board felt that since they had never received any such claims against the Pro, he had an exemplary record, and that a referee should never change a decision based on claims and protests by fans, thus they were reprimanding referee Leo Garibaldi for changing his decision. It then mentioned that the NWA was also reviewing claims submitted to them about the February 7, 1969, match between Assassin #2 & the Professional and Ray Gunkel & Buddy Fuller, where it had been alleged that Assassin #1 replaced his partner during the match.
