preservatives.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The diet also centres around low consumption of meat, dairy and sugar.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sting and his wife Trudie Styler moved their family to the Lake House Farm in&nbsp;Wiltshire in 1991, and adopted a self-sufficient diet, growing organic veggies ever since.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The singer's family own a flock of free range chickens, as well as their own trout lake and even bee hives for honey.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In her 1999 book, The Lake House Cookbook, Styler wrote: 'I decided that I would only be satisfied if I knew exactly what we were putting on our plates.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She also revealed that the couple enjoy a conscious approach to eating, and believe that the way 'we treat our own bodies is by extension the way we treat the planet.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So devoted is the singer to his diet that he reportedly keeps his own
