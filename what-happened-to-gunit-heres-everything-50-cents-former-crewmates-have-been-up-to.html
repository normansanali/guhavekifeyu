The group's leader, 50, has publicly bashed his own crewmates, and they've been at each other's throats in the past few years. To sum things up, here's what happened to G-Unit and what the members have been up to now.</p><h2 id=50-cent-is-keeping-himself-busy-with-39-power-39><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>50 Cent Is Keeping Himself Busy With 'Power'</span></h2><p>Although he's not as active in rap as he used to back in the 2000s, 50 Cent has been keeping himself busy as an actor. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">His latest Starz hit, Power, was so successful</a> that it made history as the network's most highly-rated show ever. After the season finale aired in 2019, the network announced several up-and-coming spin-offs set in the Power universe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That said, it's not the only thing that keeps money coming into the Get Rich or Die Tryin' rapper's bank account. He founded several companies, including SMS Audio, SK Energy, Effen Vodka, and more. He also curated the late Pop Smoke's debut album, Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon, which became one of the best posthumous records that hip-hop has ever seen in the past few years.</p><h2 id=tony-yayo-is-struggling-to-get-back-to-the-rap-game><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Tony Yayo Is Struggling To Get Back To The Rap Game</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, Tony Yayo spent some time behind bars during the height of G-Unit's commercial success until 2004, leaving his post vacant for Young Buck. It also wasn't the first time he had problems with the law, as in 2007, the East Coast rapper was arrested again for allegedly assaulting Jimmy Rosemond's 14-year-old son. His debut and only album, Thoughts of a Predicate Felon, peaked at number two in 2005 under Interscope and sold over 200,000 copies within the first week but he was later dropped from the label. Since then, Yayo hasn't released any full-length album apart from back-to-back mixtapes in the 2010s.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Fans Say 50 Cent Has Given Up On His Career</a></span></p><h2 id=lloyd-banks-has-just-released-his-first-solo-album-in-over-a-decade><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Lloyd Banks Has Just Released His First Solo Album In Over A Decade</span></h2><p>During his time with G-Unit, Lloyd Banks has been hailed as the group's most prolific songwriter. His witty punchlines and bars keep fans hooked and it wasn't long until he found his success as a solo rapper thanks to his first two albums, Hunger for More and Rotten Apple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Has Crystal Reed Been Up To Since Leaving 'Teen Wolf'?</a></span></p><p>However, the rapper has been going through some pretty dark times, leading up to his fall into depression in the late 2000s and the early 2010s. The pinnacle of it came in 2019 when he replied to a fan on Twitter asking if he's about to release one more bodywork in a shocking and sad tweet, "Let’s be real..ain’t nobody checking for banks anymore." Fortunately,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> he managed to fight back and independently released his first album in 11 years</a>, The Course of the Inevitable, in June 2021.</p><h2 id=young-buck-became-an-indie-artist><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Young Buck Became An Indie Artist</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Young Buck joined the group to fill the vacancy that Tony Yayo left due to his then-ongoing legal problems. Unfortunately, his time in G-Unit wasn't too long, as he departed the group in 2008 after a feud with 50 Cent. After the dispute, Buck reformed the southern branch of G-Unit Records into his own indie label, Cashville Records, distributing acts such as The Outlawz, C-Bo, D4L, and more. His latest album, The Rehab, was released in 2010 and its remix hit the stores in 2019.</p><h2 id=the-game-released-two-albums-in-3-years><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Game Released Two Albums In 3 Years</span></h2><p>The Game wasn't even included in the original line-up of G-Unit. Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, the high-ranking people at Aftermath and Interscope Records, placed the Compton native in the collective, hoping to create more buzz for the rapper and the group.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The feud was inevitable, and The Game left G-Unit officially in 2005. He's still pretty much active in the rap scene, releasing the follow-up sequel album to his classic Documentary album in 2015. His last two albums, Born 2 Rap and 30 for 30, were released in 2019 and 2021, respectively.</p><h2 id=kidd-kidd-ventured-into-management><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kidd Kidd Ventured Into Management</span></h2><p>Lastly, there's Kidd Kidd who briefly joined G-Unit amidst the group's reunion between 2014 until 2018. Before that, the New Orleans rapper signed a recording deal under 50's G-Unit Records in 2011. He was a part of XXL Magazine's annual 'Freshman' list in 2015 but later left the group to focus solely on his own label, RLLNR Entertainment. ​​​​​​​</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Has Eminem Been Up To In 2021?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brPUp6CtZZiav6a%2FjJ6tnqqpqbWqusZmbGllk5q7tb%2BMn6arpZWneqS%2BxLCkmqyVqHqprdWeZJudlaN6tryMraZo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ramona-singer-divorce-mario-singer-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Has A Higher Net Worth: Ramona Singer Or Her Ex-Husband Mario Singer?</a>
