She is known for her career in Canada in the early 1990s with two mildly successful dance-pop albums.</span></p><p><span>She was born on 1 June 1974 in Ottawa, Canada, to Georgia Mary Ann (nee Feuerstein) and Alan Richard Morissette. She has recently turned 47 this 2021. She has two brothers; older brother Chad and twin brother Wade.</span></p><p><span>After establishing herself as a capable musician in Canada, she moved to Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, as a part of a recording deal and released the album, Jagged Little Pill, which sold more than 33 million copies globally.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Net Worth And Career Of Alanis Morissette</strong></span></h2><p><span>With over decades-long works in her professional career, Alanis Morissette has accumulated a lump sum of wealth to her name. She has an estimated <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a> of $45 million. Her career earnings come from the albums she sold to date and events and tours she attended.</span></p><p><span>Morissette has maintained and proved herself as a multitalented singer and songwriter throughout her career, all while catching worldwide attention. She sold approximately 60 million albums at the height of her career in the 1990s. She has also sold 75 million albums over the course of her career. Jagged Little Pill following up with Supposed Formwe Infatuation Junkie and Under Rug Swept was the album records that earned the singer most of her income, as CelebrityNetWorth notes, due to them being released “before the advent of music streaming platforms like Napster.”</span></p><p><span>Morissette’s musical career began in 1987 when she recorded her first-ever demo, Fate Stay With Me, in Toronto, Canada. That demo helped her land a publishing deal with MCA Records in Canada. In 1991, her first album, Alanis, made its debut which helped Morissette establish as a talented artist. Her second album, Now This is Time, earned her a Juno Award for Most Promising Female Artist in 1992.</span></p><p><span>Launching all these albums, Morissette then decided to move to L.A. at 24 years old to earn more popularity. Her third album, Jagged Little Pill, released in June 1995, made with producer and songwriter Glen Ballard, helped her rise to the musical field's American stardom. The album had sold nearly 28 million copies by 1998 and received her four Grammys. And, now it has sold over 33 million worldwide and is still considered one of the bestselling albums of all time.</span></p><p><span>By the time she released her fourth album, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, in 1998, she was already a global sensation. Though the album didn’t do nearly as well with 3 million copies, she had become a personality to look out for since the 1990s.</span></p><p><span>Much later in 2017, business manager Jonathan Todd Schwartz was accused of stealing $7.2 million from several celebrities, for which he pleaded guilty of stealing nearly $5 million from Morissette between 2010 and 2014. Morissette alleged that she didn’t know until she switched her business manager and found out that her millions of earnings were missings. Later that year, Schwartz was sentenced to serve behind bars and ordered to pay over $8.5 million in restitution.</span></p><p><span>According to Rolling Stone, Morissette became the “undisputed queen of alt-rock angst” in 1995 when she released Jagged Little Pill. In 2000, she appeared nude in her music video Thank U which caused a stir in the industry, but still, the music video earned a Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Though she maintained an “undisputed queen” image for over 20 years, she has also shown a slight shift in her musical style in her later albums.</span></p><p><span>Some of her albums over the decades-long in the music industry include Now Is The Time, MTV Unplugged, Up Close, So-Called Chaos, Jagged Little Pill Acoustic, Flavors of Entanglement, Havoc, and Bright Lights, and such. Her albums were ranked in the trettleman.medium.com being Jagged Little Pill (1995) in the top, followed up with Under Rug Swept (2002), So-Called Chaos (2004), Such Pretty Forks in The Road (2020), Havoc and Bright Lights (2012), Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie (1998), Flavors of Entanglement (2008), Now is The Time (1992), and Alanis (1991).</span></p><p><span>Whereas Morisette has released several of her singles and EPs, including Too Hot, Feel Your Love, Space Cakes, You Oughta Know, Uninvited, So Pure, Precious Illusions, Utopia, Everything, Underneath, Reasons I Drink, Such Pretty Forks In The Mix, and more.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Upcoming Alanis Morissette Tours And Concerts</strong></span></h2><p><span>Alanis&nbsp;<span>Morissette</span> announced that she would be featuring on several stage performances in the Midwest on her Twitter account on 1 June 2021.</span></p><p><span>According to the performer, in her Jagged Little Pill 25th&nbsp;anniversary tour, Morissette will appear with special guests Garbage and Liz Phair across both the U.S. and Europe.</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/uploads/alanis-morissette-upcoming-tour-2021.jpg alt="alanis morissette upcoming tour 2021" width=650 height=919 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span><strong>Alanis Morissette upcoming tour 2021 (©: Twitter/Alanis Morissette)</strong></span></p><p><span>Morissette was probably set to hold the events pre-pandemic, but now the dates for her tour have been rescheduled, as she announced her change via her social media accounts.</span></p><p><span>The tour starts in August in Austin, Texas, before she heads to the East Coast of the USA for performances across Florida and New York, as well as other states. Covering some states in the USA from the beginning of her tour to 6 October 2021, she will move on to countries like Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, Hungary, Poland, Italy, Spain, France, England, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and finally wrapping up with two shows in the Philippines on&nbsp;<span>18 & 19</span> November 2022.</span></p><p><span>Presale tickets have been available from yesterday, 3 June, and general on-sale tickets for new shows begin on 4 June at 10 am local time.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Alanis Morissette Debuts With Chic Blonde Looks</strong></span></h2><p><span>Alanis&nbsp;<span>Morissette</span> is ready to showcase her skills for the tour kicking off this summer.</span></p><p><span>During an appearance on the Today show on 3 June, the singer debuts her chic and shaggy blonde hair while virtually stopping by the morning show to celebrate the 25th&nbsp;anniversary of her album, Jagged Little Pill.</span></p><p><span>After unveiling the stunning looks she got for herself on the show, she questioned how long she has been rocking the lighter rocks. Alanis responded: <strong>“Oh, I don’t even know, I’m postpartum, so it’s been a couple of months, I have no idea. I think everyone played with their hair during the pandemic time because we were all slightly insular.”</strong> However, she still rocked with her new looks with her rocking vocals during the show.</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, she’s set to hit the road for Jagged Little Pill this summer, almost two years since her original plans were postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. <strong>“I think when we all gather for rehearsals again, we might pile into each other, weeping,”</strong> she said.</span></p><p><span>The tour is set to kick off at Austin’s Germania Insurance Amphitheatre on 12 August before continuing across the USA and Europe.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Alanis Morissette Married Life With Husband Souleye</strong></span></h2><p><span>Alanis&nbsp;<span>Morissette</span> is a married woman. She tied the knot with rapper Souleye (real name Mario Treadway) in May 2010 and has been together since. The duo has even collaborated on a song called Soul Angel in February 2017, and they’re raising three children; Ever Imre, Onyx Solace, and Winter Mercy Morissette-Treadway together.</span></p><p><span>During an interview in the last of 2020 with the Elle USA Women In Concert Celebration, Morissette spoke about her iconic breakup album, Jagged Little Pill, as well as about her relationship with her husband. Though the couple has a hardship in raising three children together and giving continuity to their professional career, she said that they were “helping each other out.”</span></p><p><span>She continued, “<strong>Relationships go from infatuation to power struggle, and then most people break up. I think it’s getting juicy as we’re going on the third phase of helping each other heal and grow.”</strong> While asked about the secret of staying and growing together, Morissette jokingly says that it’s “Flirting” and “dates, gifts, and compliments.”</span></p><p><span>Alanis has such a big age gap between her kids. And during a mid-2020 interview, in which she explains the reason for it, saying, <strong>“We were chasing and just showing up and then [expecting the] surprises and then devastations and all of it.”</strong> She faced “a bunch of miscarriages” between her children. Nevertheless, the unique dynamics have worked really well for Morissette and Treadway, even if the timing of her pregnancies wasn’t what she first thought it would be.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunCvxKWcm6qZqbamv46ao5qmmah6rrvRoqqsnaSpsm66xK1ksKeiqbVuwM6uqWabn6Owpr7TZqOop5uoeqnB0puYp5w%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./chris-pratt-family.html>&#171;&nbsp;Family of Guardians of the Galaxy Star-Lord Chris Pratt</a>
