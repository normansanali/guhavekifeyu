One such champion monkey was named Jacco Macacco. He fought in monkey-baiting matches in London in the early 1820s and defeated 14 dogs before he had his jaw torn off by a fierce dog named Puss and died not long after the match.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Bear-Baiting</h2><img alt="Bear Baiting" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bear-baiting.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body><a href=#>Bear-baiting</a> was particularly popular in 16th- and 17th-century England. The sport involved chaining a bear to a stake either by its leg or by its neck. Dogs were then unleashed into the pit to torment the wild animal.<p>Henry VIII was particularly fond of this cruel sport, as was Queen Elizabeth I, who went so far as to overrule Parliament's decision to ban bear-baiting on Sundays.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Bear-Whipping</h2><img alt="Bear Whipping" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bear-garden-whipping.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>Whipping the blind bear was another popular pastime enjoyed in 16th and 17th century England.

In 17th century, cock-throwing was banned in Bristol by Puritan officials which resulted in violent riots. Cock-throwing began to lose its popularity when the public grew increasingly concerned with animal welfare.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Badger-Baiting</h2><img alt="Badger In A Box" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/badger-in-a-box.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Popular from the Middle Ages until the 19th century, badger-baiting usually took place in the back gardens of taverns, where owners encouraged these bloody spectacles because they increased beer sales.<p>In some cases, the tail of the badger was nailed to the ground. The badger was then baited either until it died from the injuries caused by the dogs or from tail gangrene. The dogs were also often injured so badly that they had to be euthanized.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Drawing The Badger</h2><img alt="Badgers In Boxes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/badgers-in-boxes.jpg> <span class=caption-body>A variation on badger baiting, drawing the badger became a popular sport in the early 20th century. The sport involved placing a badger inside a box that looked like its den. A dog was then pushed into the box and was almost immediately seized by the badger.<p>Drawing the badger was basically a way to test dogs; inexperienced dogs were often brutally mauled by the badgers and in some cases even killed.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Fox-Tossing</h2><img alt="Fox Tossing" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/fox-tossing.jpg> <span class=caption-body>The rules of fox-tossing, one of the animal blood sports popular among 17th- and 18th-century European aristocracy, were simple: Teams of two stood in a small courtyard holding each end of a sling sheet. As foxes were released into the courtyard, each team focused hard on tossing the fox into the air with their sling. The team that tossed the fox the highest would win.<p>Some competitors managed to throw foxes 7.5 meters high. As you can imagine, this sport was, in most cases, fatal for the foxes.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Lion-Baiting</h2><img alt="Lion Baiting" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/lion-baiting.jpg> <span class=caption-body>The first recorded lion-baiting took place at the court of King James I of England in 1610. But it wasn't until the 19th century that the public grew outraged enough such that the matter was quickly raised in the Parliament of United Kingdom and the sport was soon banned.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Donkey-Baiting</h2><img alt="Donkey Baiting" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/donkey-baiting.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Donkey-baiting was not an unusual sight in Victorian England. However, it never really took off like some other animal blood sports due to the mild nature of donkeys, who, in most cases, refused to fight the dogs. </span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Duck-Baiting</h2><img alt="Duck Baiting" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/duck-baiting.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Duck-baiting, popular in early 19th-century England, involved constraining the wings of ducks and then releasing them into a pond. With their wings constrained, the ducks were able to float atop the water but were unable to fly away. Dogs were then released into the pond and a water battle between the dog and the duck ensued.<p>It is said that Charles II was particularly fond of duck-baiting. However, the sport declined in the late 19th century due to public alarm over the rowdy crowds.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Pato</h2><img alt="Pato Animal Blood Sports" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/pato-sport.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Pato, also known as Juego del Pato, is an Argentinian game that is played on horseback. The game combines elements of polo and basketball and is still popular to this day. However, some forget that the early version of the sport was played with a duck instead of a ball, hence the name of the game: "Pato" (duck). </span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Rat-Baiting</h2><img alt="Rat Baiting" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/rat-baiting.jpg> <span class=caption-body><a href=#>Rat-baiting</a> was popular in 19th-century Britain.

Their entertainment options were severely limited and yet they found countless ways to amuse themselves, some of which were far more violent than the leisure activities of today.</p><p>While nowadays we can satisfy our thirst for violence by switching on a crime show, back in the day (whether it was centuries ago, mere decades ago, or even still in some places today), that thirst could be satisfied by some truly disturbing animal blood sports instead.
