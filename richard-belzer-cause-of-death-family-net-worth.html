and author known for his portrayal of the character Detective John Munch in various television series.</strong></p><p>He was born on August 4, 1944, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and grew up in a Jewish family. Belzer attended Dean College in Franklin, Massachusetts, before transferring to Northeastern University in Boston to study journalism.</p><p>Belzer began his career in entertainment as a stand-up comedian, performing at various venues in New York City in the 1970s. He gained national attention in 1978 with his appearance on “Saturday Night Live,” where he delivered a monologue about his experience with UFO sightings. Belzer’s deadpan delivery and offbeat humor became his trademark, and he went on to appear on numerous comedy specials and talk shows.</p><p>In 1981, Belzer made his acting debut in the film “The Ninth Configuration,” directed by William Peter Blatty. He followed up with roles in “Fame” (1982), “Scarface” (1983), and “The Natural” (1984). In 1993, Belzer began portraying Detective John Munch on the television series “Homicide: Life on the Street.” The character was based on a real-life Baltimore detective, and Belzer’s portrayal earned critical acclaim. He appeared on the show for seven seasons before transitioning to the spin-off series “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.”</p><p>Belzer’s portrayal of Detective Munch on “Law & Order: SVU” made him one of the most recognizable television characters of the 2000s. The character appeared on the show for fifteen seasons, from 1999 to 2014. Belzer also appeared as Detective Munch in crossovers with other television series, including “The X-Files,” “The Beat,” and “Arrested Development.”</p><p>In addition to his work as an actor, Belzer has also authored several books. His first book, “UFOs, JFK, and Elvis: Conspiracies You Don’t Have to Be Crazy to Believe,” was published in 1999. He followed up with “How to Be a Stand-Up Comic” (2008), “I Am Not a Cop!” (2009), and “Dead Wrong: Straight Facts on the Country’s Most Controversial Cover-Ups” (2012).</p><p>Belzer’s career has not been without controversy. In 1992, he was sued for making derogatory comments about a female flight attendant during a comedy routine. The lawsuit was settled out of court. In 2006, Belzer was involved in a physical altercation with a Fox News producer during an interview. The incident was captured on camera and received widespread media attention.</p><p>Belzer announced his retirement from acting in 2016, citing health concerns. However, he has continued to make occasional appearances in films and television shows. In recent years, he has also been active on social media, sharing his views on politics and current events with his followers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Richard Belzer Cause of Death</h2><p>For some time now, his death has been declining, and unfortunately, he could not recover as he passed away on February 19, 2023.
