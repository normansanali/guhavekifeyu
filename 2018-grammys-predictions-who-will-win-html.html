In just a few days, it’ll become clear who the Recording Academy has deemed <a href=#>the best of the best in the previous year in music</a>. Could Lorde upset in Album of the Year to edge out all the boys? Might “Despacito” make history? Will we ever understand <a href=#>what the hell is happening in the rock category</a>? At least two of those mysteries should be solved by the weekend’s end. It all remains open for debate, but we’ve made some educated guesses (plus a few shots in the dark) about how the night will play out. Below we present Vulture’s annual way-too-comprehensive <a href=#>Grammy </a>predictions. Hundreds of golden gramophones will be handed out on January 28, when the show gets underway <a href=#>on CBS</a>. Check back to compare scorecards and stay tuned for our continued coverage.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjcuq306o000z3d61qr1bdq2y@published>Album of the Year</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcuoqep000122c5srvnszyow@published data-word-count=12>Bruno Mars, 24K Magic<br>Childish Gambino, Awaken, My Love!<br>Jay-Z, 4:44<br>Kendrick Lamar, DAMN.<br>Lorde, Melodrama</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcuowqn8001c2c5sj5r9ci89@published data-word-count=309><strong>Who Will Win:</strong> This could get real thorny. It’s not every year the AOTY field is almost entirely comprised of people of color. It’s unfortunate that those nominees are all men (justice for SZA!), but that fact can’t be ignored. Lorde herself has talked about what an opportunity this is for the Grammys to get with the times, <a href=#>telling Billboard</a>, “It’s exciting when these institutions move in the right way. To me, that is a huge victory.” It’s been a decade since an artist of color won this award (Herbie Hancock last won it in 2008), and in that time, white women have had a lot of success (Taylor Swift and Adele won it twice). Though it would cause an uproar — which the Grammys must know — I see this award going Lorde’s way. Curiously, this is the only award she’s nominated for, but that it’s the biggest pretty much says it all. Lorde is also a previous Grammy winner. In the history of the Grammys, only two rap albums have ever won AOTY (and let’s not forget that they didn’t actually consider Lauryn Hill rap; Miseducation was nominated as an R&B album). It’s incredible that there are even two nominated in the same year now (which has only happened three times prior), but that may be as far as their acknowledgement goes. The stats aren’t any better for R&B because while more R&B albums have certainly won in this category it’s been awhile. Lauryn Hill was the last in 1999, and if you count that as rap, then you’re looking even further back to Whitney Houston in 1994. My hunch is that having two rap and two R&B albums on the ballot will work against each other and push Lorde forward. Melodrama is a phenomenal album, but it’s a shame that it might win under these circumstances.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcuowqnd001d2c5s42db4msq@published data-word-count=133><strong>Who Should Win: </strong>There isn’t a bad album of the bunch, which is rare. You could make a case for why every one of these should win (though Childish Gambino’s would be the weakest). A win for Jay-Z would be his first in this category because it’s also the first time he’s ever been nominated for AOTY. A win for Kendrick would be his first after two previous tries. Same for Bruno, after one prior nom. The fact is Jay-Z should’ve won for his earlier, superior work. That he could win AOTY for an album that doesn’t stand up to the likes of Reasonable Doubt would be weird, but also very much in line with the typical thinking of the Grammys. I like Kendrick Lamar best for this award in this particular year.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjcuq4d8j001b3d61wa7768ap@published>Song of the Year</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcuowqnf001g2c5sla060jha@published data-word-count=23>Jay-Z, “4:44”<br>Julia Michaels, “Issues”<br>Logic ft.

On the one hand, it would make history if the Grammys gave a songwriting award to “Despacito,” which is written almost entirely in Spanish (not counting Bieber’s parts). But I’m going to guess there’s a small percentage of Grammy voters who understand Spanish (this is why we have the Latin Grammys), so its chances are slim here. (More on that below). Then there’s “4:44,” which is Jay-Z at his most confessional. And, as of last summer, he’s a Hall of Fame songwriter. I think “1-800-273-8255” will edge out the competition for being the perfect storm: First, it features two Best New Artist contenders so you know it’s already on a lot of Grammy voters’ radar. Second, it sparked social change, with <a href=#>the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline reporting</a> multiple spikes in calls because of this song. That won’t be overlooked by the Academy. Third, it’s beautiful — somber but never losing hope.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcuowqni001l2c5sod3es0qb@published data-word-count=30><strong>Who Should Win:</strong> There are people alive right now who might not be if it weren’t for “1-800-273-8255.” I can’t think of a better reason for a song to win.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjcuq64du001r3d61bv70yhv8@published>Record of the Year</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcuowqnj001n2c5sgjd4r2fa@published data-word-count=20>Childish Gambino, “Redbone”<br>Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee ft.

It’ll likely go down as the biggest song of the decade and one of the biggest songs in the history of recorded music. It is also just plain fun and, were it to win, would mean the highest acknowledgement of reggaeton’s mainstream influence and the Latinx diaspora that the Grammys have ever given. Sure, Santana won this once for “Smooth,” but there isn’t a lick of Spanish in that song; “Despacito” would be the first Spanish-language song to ever win ROTY. You could argue that it isn’t the Grammys’ responsibility to send political and cultural messages with its choice of winners, but operating apolitically in these times is a bad look.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcuowqnl001t2c5so0vnz06c@published data-word-count=9><strong>Who Should Win:</strong> In case I wasn’t clear: “Despacito.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjcuq837f00283d61o4vjqkx3@published>Best New Artist</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcuowqnm001v2c5sds0ptb4d@published data-word-count=5>Alessia Cara<br>Khalid<br>Lil Uzi Vert<br>Julia Michaels<br>SZA</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcuowqnn00202c5snpkt0udj@published data-word-count=36><strong>Who Will Win:</strong> SZA is the most-nominated woman of the night with one of the most celebrated albums of last year (truly, Ctrl should replace Childish Gambino’s album up at AOTY).

Unless of course “Stand Up for Something,” which was just nominated for this year’s Oscars (the Grammys and Oscars run on slightly different eligibility timelines), pulls off the upset. This is also one of only two chances the Grammys have to show Taylor Swift some love, but that’s slim.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcuowqp3007z2c5sx6adu99a@published data-word-count=30><strong>Who Should Win: </strong>Not that he needs it for his EGOT odds since he already has a Grammy, but Lin-Manuel Miranda’s song for Moana still gets me every single time.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjcuwpch6001t3d61qdeo9bbu@published>Best Spoken Word Album</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcuowqp400812c5s6hlzxnun@published data-word-count=36>Neil deGrasse Tyson, Astrophysics for People in a Hurry<br>Bruce Springsteen, Born to Run<br>Shelly Peiken, Confessions of a Serial Songwriter<br>Bernie Sanders and Mark Ruffalo, Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In (Bernie Sanders)<br>Carrie Fisher, The Princess Diarist</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcuowqp600862c5s1utgqkpo@published data-word-count=49><strong>Who Will Win:</strong> Given he’s a longtime Grammy favorite with a pretty decent batting average, the odds are likely in Bruce Springsteen’s favor.
