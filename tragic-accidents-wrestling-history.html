He’d usually have a beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other (one of those hands would also be on the wheel). Early on during his career, the practice caused a car accident that killed Race’s pregnant wife and left him in the hospital. Doctors wanted to amputate his leg, but the future 7 time NWA champion refused, lending credence that he really was the toughest man to ever walk the face of God’s green earth.</p><h2 id=joey-marella><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Joey Marella</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Joey-Marella-Refereeing-WrestleMania-III-Cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Gorilla Monsoon</a> was never quite the same again after his son, Joey Marella died in a car accident, and no one could blame him one bit.

But on a dark and stormy night in 1986, he unfortunately lost control of his Porsche and crashed into a telephone pole. His C4 and C5 vertebrae were shattered and there was little hope he’d ever walk again much less wrestle.

Clearly that’s not what happened at all - after three months of intense physical therapy, Naitch was back in the ring to cement his legacy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmekp66otcJmmJybmZmyr8DSZq6rnaOpuaq6xmafoqukpL%2B6ew%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-crazy-history-of-water-wars.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Crazy History Of Water Wars</a>
