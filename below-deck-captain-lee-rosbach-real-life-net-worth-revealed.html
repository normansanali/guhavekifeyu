Lee Rosbach takes a no-nonsense approach when it comes to operating his vessel and watching over his crew. Fans see a lot of the captain on the show, but the truth behind what his life is really like when he's off the yacht is sure to shock many. There are more than a few fun facts about Captain Lee that will keep fans on their toes...</p><h2 id=yachting-wasn-39-t-captain-lee-rosbach-39-s-first-passion><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Yachting Wasn't Captain Lee Rosbach's First Passion</span></h2><p>Captain Lee Rosbach seems like a natural who was born into this role, but the truth is, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being a Captain wasn't Lee Rosbach's first career choice. </a>In fact, he was initially a very successful restaurateur. The Michigan-native managed a number of restaurants in the Turks & Caicos and was very happy with his career choice. That all changed when one of his friends invited him to work on a sailboat for some extra cash. It was at this time that Lee recognized his passion for being at sea.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Rayna Lindsey's Life Outside 'Below Deck'</a></span></p><h2 id=lee-rosbach-gave-up-his-career-to-become-a-captain><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Lee Rosbach Gave Up His Career To Become A Captain</span></h2><p>At the age of 35, it seemed Lee had his life in order. He had a happy marriage and was thriving in his career as a restaurateur, but he suddenly made a huge career change and opted to train to become a captain, at the age of 35. He worked hard and quickly obtained his license. It wasn't long before he was yachting and pursuing a dramatically different lifestyle, which eventually led him to taking on the leading role in Below Deck.</p><h2 id=captain-lee-rosbach-is-a-stickler-for-safety><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Captain Lee Rosbach Is A Stickler For Safety</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>There's a lot of chaotic fun that ensues on the yacht, </a>most of which hovers on the edge of being downright wild. There is definitely no shortage of drunken fun and wild parties for the crew and guests on Below Deck to enjoy, but Captain Lee is far more focused on other things to get too caught up in the chaos. He is a real stickler for safety and consistently puts the health and well-being of everyone on board his vessel above all else.</p><h2 id=lee-rosbach-39-s-huge-family><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Lee Rosbach's Huge Family</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Captain Lee has a huge, loving family, and he looks forward to being surrounded by them each time he returns home.

When he told her he was giving up his successful career in the restaurant industry, she fully supported his choice and stood behind him in support of his new job opportunity. Mary rallied around her husband despite the fact that his job took him away from home and left her alone a lot of the time. She has commented on that by indicating that "absence really does make the heart grow fonder."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=captain-lee-tragically-lost-his-youngest-son><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Captain Lee Tragically Lost His Youngest Son</span></h2><p>Sadly, Captain Lee Rosbach suffered a tragic loss in July 2019, when news broke that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> his youngest son, named Josh, passed away </a>at the age of 42.
