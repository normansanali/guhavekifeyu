We are totally connected to all of the characters from the show, their lives, and everything that they have been through. In season one, everything was about Hannah Baker, a girl who took her own life after facing traumatic experiences that led her down the path of depression and isolation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1>The second season of the show was focused more on the character of Clay Jensen and the aftermath of his life, after losing Hannah Baker. The second season of the show&nbsp;focused&nbsp;a lot on his friendships and his attempts at romance. The third season of the show was sort of like an investigation as we watched our favorite characters try to pursue justice. Now, we are eagerly waiting on the release of the highly anticipated fourth and final season of the show!</p><h2 id=season-4-will-most-likely-come-out-october-2020><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Season 4 Will (Most Likely) Come Out October 2020</span></h2><p class=p1>Based on the pattern that we have seen with the first 3 season releases of 13 Reasons Why, season&nbsp;4 will most likely be released in October 2020. The reason why fans are speculating that this will be the release date is that it has taken the cast and crew about 14 months to film and edit each season prior to this one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dylan-minnette-is-expected-to-return-as-clay-jensen><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Dylan Minnette Is Expected To Return As Clay Jensen</span></h2><p class=p1>Dylan Minnette is the leading actor of this show and he plays the role of Clay Jensen. Clay Jensen was in love with Hannah Baker before she ended her own life and he feels as if he is partially to blame for her decision to do that. He is one of the characters who has a really good heart and he is someone that we have been rooting for from the very beginning.</p><h2 id=it-will-probably-have-13-episodes-like-all-three-previous-seasons><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>It Will Probably Have 13 Episodes, Like All Three Previous Seasons</span></h2><p class=p1>The show itself is called 13 Reasons Why and every season so far has had 13 episodes! So it is safe to assume that the fourth season will also have 13 episodes, to go along with the pattern and the title of the show. But honestly, we would be even more excited if there were more than 13 episodes coming to us in the final season!</p><h2 id=christian-navarro-is-expected-to-return-as-tony-padilla><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Christian Navarro Is Expected To Return As Tony Padilla</span></h2><p class=p1>Christian Navarro is an awesome actor and he played the role of Tony Padilla. Tony Padilla was one of Hannah Baker’s only trustworthy friends while she was still alive. He totally had her back… Except for the day that she dropped off the tapes on his doorstep. We are happy that Christian Navarro is coming back for season 4.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dylan-minnette-said-season-four-is-emo><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Dylan Minnette Said Season Four Is "Emo"</span></h2><p>On Twitter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dylan Minnette wrote</a>, “We are officially wrapped 13 Reasons Why the other night. It’s been a life-changing 4 years of making the show, and an era/chapter I won’t forget. Super grateful to everyone involved. Excited for you all to see the final season next year. It’s Emo.” Despite the show being emo, we are still VERY excited to see it!</p><h2 id=the-season-four-trailer-hasn-t-dropped-yet><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>The Season Four&nbsp;Trailer Hasn't Dropped (Yet)</span></h2><p class=p1>The trailer for season&nbsp;4 has not been released yet but we are definitely waiting on it! The trailer that was released for season&nbsp;2 was super intense and the trailer that was released for season&nbsp;3 pulled&nbsp;every viewer in and made us want to continue watching the show to see how the story was going to continue.</p><h2 id=ross-butler-is-expected-to-return-as-zach-dempsey><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Ross Butler Is Expected To Return As Zach Dempsey</span></h2><p class=p1>Ross Butler is one of the most attractive actors in the entire show. He plays the role of Zack Dempsey and we are so excited that we will see more of him in season four of 13 Reasons Why. Ross Butler is definitely one of our favorite actors from the show and the character he plays is one of the people who was actually supportive of Hannah Baker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alisha-boe-is-expected-to-return-as-jessica-davis><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Alisha Boe&nbsp;Is Expected To Return As Jessica Davis</span></h2><p class=p1>Alisha Boe is an incredible young actress and she took on the role of Jessica Davis with so much ferocity and so much heart! The fact that she was able to take on such a challenging role at such a young age is very impressive and it makes us love her so much more! We are so happy that she’s coming back.</p><h2 id=the-4th-season-will-be-the-final-season><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The 4th Season Will Be The Final Season</span></h2><p class=p1>It has been confirmed that the fourth season of 13 Reasons Why will be the final season of the show. We wish that the show was continuing on further, but if this is where the story ends then so be it. We are just hoping that there are no loose ends or unfinished questions left for us to figure out by the end of the final episode.</p><h2 id=ross-butler-confirmed-the-wrap-of-season-four-on-december-20-2019><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Ross Butler Confirmed The Wrap Of Season Four On December 20, 2019</span></h2><p>The day that the cast of 13 Reasons Why finished filming season 4, Ross butler confirmed that they truly were finished filming! He posted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to Instagram</a>, “Wrapped for the last time last night. Still doesn’t feel real. What a ride it has been…” It was probably a super fun ride for the entire cast and crew of the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brandon-flynn-is-expected-to-return-as-justin-foley><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Brandon Flynn&nbsp;Is Expected To Return As Justin Foley</span></h2><p class=p1>Brandon Flynn is the actor behind the role of Justin Foley. The character of Justin Foley is a very troubled young man who struggles with issues like substance abuse and familial neglect. He is someone that other troubled youth can connect with and relate to.</p><h2 id=rj-brown-spoke-out-about-the-end-of-13-reasons-why><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>RJ Brown Spoke Out About The End Of '13 Reasons Why'</span></h2><p>RJ Brown posted to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his Instagram</a>, "End of a chapter. 13 Reasons Why taught me SO much both personally and professionally.

Alex Standall is a really interesting character that we have a lot of empathy for. He obviously went through a lot in his life and because of that, it caused him to act out in ways that some might say are unforgivable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christian-navarro-said-goodbye-to-his-character-when-they-wrapped-filming-season-four-of-13-reasons-why><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Christian Navarro Said Goodbye To His Character When They Wrapped Filming Season Four Of '13 Reasons Why'</span></h2><p>Christian Navarro wrote <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Instagram</a>, "Today I say goodbye to one of my heroes. Tony Padilla has taught me so much, about courage under pressure, grace in the face of hate and discrimination, kindness, and what it means to be a great friend. Playing this character has made me a better man." He did such a great job taking on the role of Tony. The entire cast did a great job in their respective roles and we are excited to see season 4!</p><h2 id=devin-druid-is-expected-to-return-as-tyler-down><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Devin Druid&nbsp;Is Expected To Return As Tyler Down</span></h2><p class=p1>Devon Druid is another great actor that we are excited to see more of in season 4. He played the role of Tyler Down, a troubled teenager who was facing a lot of bullying on his high school campus. Some of what he endured is atrocious, humiliating, and heartbreaking. We hope that he is able to get the justice that he deserves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhobGWimq60u82sZLCgqWLApq3SqKVmbF2brqTA0mg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./five-things-you-may-not-know-about-splash-mountain.html>&#171;&nbsp;Five Things You May Not Know About Splash Mountain</a>
