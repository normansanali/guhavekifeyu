just one AFC championship game away from reaching the Super Bowl … with quarterback Blake Bortles leading the way. If you’re a regular Good Place viewer, you know what that means: Despite all the times that Michael and Eleanor have made fun of both Bortles and the Jags, Jason Mendoza’s dreams may be about to come true. Too bad the dude’s dead.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcl6f1s9000r3d5z2inm5fly@published data-word-count=61><a href=#>Last week’s episode</a> was a great one for Jason (and for the actor who plays him, <a href=#>Manny Jacinto</a>). As Eleanor and her fellow dirtbag humans prepared to say good-bye to their Neighborhood, Jason’s combination of naïveté and enthusiasm came off as genuinely charming, such that for a fleeting moment, he seemed genuinely Good — in the capital-G, worthy-of-the–Real Good Place sense.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcl6f1s4000p3d5zg7cz1gaq@published data-word-count=106>This week’s “Rhonda, Diana, Jake, and Trent” is another great Jason episode, but for a different reason: It’s a reminder of what a sleaze our failed Jaxson DJ was on Earth. Most of this episode takes place at a party in Bad Place headquarters, held at the Hall of Low-Grade Crappiness in the Museum of Human Misery. For much of the time that we’re in the museum, Jason — in disguise as “Jake Jortles” — is surrounded by agents from the Bad Place’s “Department of Toxic Masculinity.” He fits right in with the bros’ surprise crotch-punches and ranking of MMA ring girls. This is his crowd.</p><h2 class=related-stories-title data-editable=title>Related Stories</h2><a href=# class="related-story-link has-image bg-story-HFVgWPrP"><span class=img></span> <span class=title>Who Will Play The Good Place’s Eternal Judge?</span></a> <a href=# class="related-story-link has-image bg-story-648mu1sG"><span class=img></span> <span class=title>The Good Place’s Jameela Jamil Nearly Killed Mary Berry With Her Meringue</span></a> <a href=# class="related-story-link has-image bg-story-vrSMU7Sl"><span class=img></span> <span class=title>The Hilarity and Horror of Ted Danson on The Good Place</span></a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcl6f1s6000q3d5zrqphepay@published data-word-count=148>It’s good for Jason that he meets these jamokes, because otherwise his masquerade was doomed. When Janet whips up a suit for him to wear, he complains that the clothes remind him of court. When she throws him a briefcase, he does his best impression of what he thinks a businessman might say: “Take my credit card to the hedge fund! I’ll meet you at the martini store!” But once he’s in the heart of the Bad Place, Jake Jortles is a natural. He admires the awesome museum exhibit of the first white man to wear dreadlocks (also the first person to call Ultimate Frisbee “ultimate”) and he declares that he’s from the Molotov cocktail torture department, because that’s a subject he actually knows a lot about. On Earth, every time he had a problem he’d throw a Molotov cocktail, “And right away I had a different problem!”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcl6f1vi00153d5zy2nj0mmp@published data-word-count=106>While Jake Jortles sails through the Bad Place, Chidi is struggling. Uncomfortable with the idea of lying even to save his immortal soul, Chidi’s problems are compounded by the fact that a random demon (played by Kristen Bell’s real-life husband Dax Shepard) thinks he’s a former co-worker named “Trent,” who’s a master torturer. Fighting against his own moral compass, Chidi finally embraces his alias by suggesting the Toxic Masculinity demons “think outside the bun,” and force their victim to read moral philosophy textbooks. Then he taps one of the dudes hard on the nards and trills, “That’s what you get for questioning Trrrrrrent, the torture master!”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcl6f1tp000t3d5zwzc2j3q9@published data-word-count=57>Chidi gets (im)moral support from Eleanor, who’s dubbed herself “Diana Tremaine” from “123 Whatever Street, Canada City, Canada.” Even though she’s using her favorite old fake-ID info, Eleanor is still enough of her Neighborhood-trained “best self” to recall what she learned from Chidi’s books about “moral particularism,” and how it relates to what’s commonly called situational ethics.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcl6f1tu000x3d5zosxok27r@published data-word-count=133>The central dilemma for our heroes as they try to make their way to the real Good Place is whether they can convince the ultimate arbiter — <a href=#>the mysterious Eternal Judge</a> — that they’ve changed. Eleanor clearly has. Even if she’s ultimately using her newfound education to exploit loopholes and beat the system, she’s doing it primarily because she now cares about other people. The jury is still out as to whether Chidi has fully overcome his irritating indecision. As for Jason? Yeah, not much has improved either for him or for Tahani, who’s disturbingly at ease in the Bad Place pretending to be <a href=#>a hot-dog-themed torturer</a> named “Rhonda Mumps.” (Tahani credits her facility with lying to <a href=#>dating Johnny Depp</a>, where she learned to say, “No, your whole thing isn’t exhausting at all!”)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcl6f1tt000w3d5z0qez4bt2@published data-word-count=85>“Rhonda, Diana, Jake, and Trent” doesn’t really resolve whether our humans deserve to graduate from Bad to Good. But there is a moment late in the episode when Eleanor & Co. see animatronic versions of themselves immortalized in the Museum of Human Misery, and as with Michael’s cruel comedy roast in “<a href=#>Leap to Faith</a>,” the simplified versions of our heroes in the exhibit seem … unfair? Incomplete? Whether this bunch ultimately qualifies for the Good Place, there’s certainly more to them than their worst traits.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcl6f1ts000v3d5zop6yt5tf@published data-word-count=157>Visually, this episode is a stunner. It’s becoming clear why so many chapters have been confined to one or two sets: Presumably, showrunner Michael Schur has conserved his budget for the likes of “<a href=#>Dance Dance Resolution</a>” and “Rhonda, Diana, Jake, and Trent,” which demand more locations, more costumes, and more special effects. If so, that choice pays off in this particular half-hour, which has wonder aplenty, from the train ride through limbo to those robotic versions of Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, and Jason. And that’s not even taking into account Bad Place headquarters, which are just as imposing as the last time we saw them. A mix of The Apartment and an overbearing ‘80s Super Bowl commercial, the Bad Place offices reflect the personality of Michael’s boss Shawn, who purposefully took the form of a 45-year-old white man so that everything and everyone would conform around him, even when he’s wrong. (“I can only fail up,” he boasts.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcl6f1tq000u3d5zazu9ok5m@published data-word-count=93>Of course, the gang’s trip through the Bad Place ceases to be an undercover mission after their likenesses go up in the Hall of Low-Grade Crappiness. They quickly hightail it to their designated exit-portal, where they discover they’re one executive pin short of being able to get all four humans plus Michael (plus Janet, who counts as “luggage”) into the void. Michael sacrifices himself for Eleanor, saying that he’s “solved the trolley problem” … and perhaps proving that he’s the only one in the group who’s actually earned his redemption. The credits roll.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcl6f1tm000s3d5zhyfn713l@published data-word-count=99>That’s a lovely emotional button to an otherwise action-packed and riotously funny episode. But there’s another moment during the escape that’s just as nice, if not as immediately obvious. Remember back during Jason’s season-one flashback, when we saw him toss a Molotov cocktail at a yacht while shouting, “Bortles!” (If you were on Twitter at all during the Jaguars’ win last weekend, surely you saw it multiple times <a href=#>in GIF form</a>.) Well, when Jake throws his booze-bomb this week, he naturally yells, “Jortles!” Then, as he’s leaping to the void he shouts, “Portles!” in tribute to his favorite quarterback.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcl6f1uc000y3d5z7vp4ez9k@published data-word-count=26>Maybe Jason sees a difference between the jerky Jortles and the awesome Bortles? If so, maybe that means there’s still hope for this dopey, destructive Floridian.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcl6f1up00133d5zjq3kpjj6@published data-word-count=2>Go Jags!</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjcl6f5cp001a3d5zjnf1qnar@published>Beyond the Neighborhood</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcl6f1uo00103d5zvxi3cdmq@published data-word-count=76>• Marvel at the wonders in the Museum of Human Misery!
