Pratt was working as a waiter in Hawaii when destiny found him and he met with Rae Dawn Chong. She immediately liked his looks and energy and cast him in her directional debut, the third art of Cursed (2000); this immediately opened the door for many other opportunities to come rushing in. After a few years of remarkable success, Chris was approached to play the role of Peter Quill on the science fiction film series. Interestingly, he turned down the role but the film’s casting director somehow convinced the director that he was the perfect man for the job and they came back to him. Christopher Michael Pratt signed the multi-film deal eventually and it has become one of the biggest deals of his career.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> June 21, 1979</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Cancer</p><p style=text-align:justify>Before starring in his breakout role on Parks and Recreation (2009 – 2015), Pratt worked as a door-to-door salesman. He mentioned that he was selling coupons for oil changes or spa trips and those days were actually prepping him for when he would start auditioning for roles in movies. These are reasons why the actor believes in God and the divine as when he takes a look at his life, he sees some form of pre-determined plan. &nbsp;The Jurassic World (2015) lead actor has been a nominee for several top awards since his teenage years but is yet to go home with an Academy Award.</p><p style=text-align:justify>When Christopher got married, his wife was bigger than him but in the space of eight years, he has now reached the top of the Hollywood ladder with opportunities taking him all over the world and sees that things are way different up here. This rise to stardom has not only brought him international fame but has cost him his relationship.

She started acting since she was nine but rose to fame through her lead role in the Scary Movie films series (2000 – 2013). Her first marriage was to Ben Indra whom she had met on the set of indie film Lovers Lane (1999). It lasted for three years with a 2007 divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences. Anna and Chris met in 2007 on the set of Take Me Home Tonight (2011) and indeed they ended up home together after their July 2009 wedding in Bali.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The long time couple announced on August 7 their impending separation after eight years of being together. According to them they tried for a long time but are really disappointed things could no longer be contained. While Faris wants a stable Los Angeles family with more kids, the Guardians of the Galaxy film series (2014 – 2017), star was more than content with being the father of one at least for now. He also acknowledges the fact that right now in his career, his job has the potential of keeping him away from home for months and he can’t be so committed to staying in one place. There were other personal reasons for the split but these were some of the reasons why they decided to part ways.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Chris Pratt's then-spouse Anna Faris" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bodyheightweight.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/chris-pratt-family-ex-wife-anna-faris.jpg alt="Chris Pratt's family - ex-wife Anna Kay Faris" width=800 height=529 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p style=text-align:justify>Faris hinted that her marriage to the star actor was not as happy as they hinted with their incessant PDA infused-appearances in the public and on social media. Marriage in Hollywood is indeed tricky; she laments and would rather be in a “normal” marriage where one party wasn’t always absent. An insider stated that Chris’s sudden rise to superstardom has a big role to play in his split as both lovers apparently did not have a road map for what they could become. The wheels have been set in motion for a divorce but they say it would be as amicable as it can get.</p><h2>Chris Pratt wife</h2><p><strong>Katherine Schwarzenegger</strong> (wife)</p><p><img decoding=async title="Chris Pratt's fiancee Katherine Schwarzenegger" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bodyheightweight.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/chris-pratt-family-fiancee-Katherine-Schwarzenegger.jpg alt="Chris Pratt's family - fiancee Katherine Schwarzenegger" width=800 height=428 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Duration of Relation:</strong> June 2018 – till present (got engaged on January 14, 2019, married June 2019)</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:&nbsp;</strong>December 13, 1989</p><p><strong>Zodiac sign:&nbsp;</strong>Sagittarius</p><p style=text-align:justify>They first were seen together in June 2018 at a picnic in the park.
