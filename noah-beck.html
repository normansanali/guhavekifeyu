Noah Beck, the most heavily rumored nominee, was widely expected to enter the Sway House, but no official announcement had been made as of June 2020. Noah appeared in a TikTok video with Sway House members Quinton Griggs and Blake Gray in May 2020. Noah clearly responded with an ellipsis when a fan said, “respond if you’re joining Sway.”</p><p>Furthermore, Noah seemed to spend a lot of time with Sway Houseguests, and he has posted a lot of photos of them together on his Instagram. Noah’s popularity was only going to skyrocket once he joined Sway House. Noah made a good living as a soccer player, and he made even more money with TikTok. Noah Beck’s net worth is projected to be around $150 thousand as of 2020. Noah dropped out of college to become a full-time influencer, according to a new rumor that emerged around July 2020.

Noah responded to a tweet from @harliebott on March 13, 2016, asking for a girlfriend. However, it was unknown if she ever got him one. Furthermore, Noah wrote on Instagram on June 17, 2020, “dear future mom, can we pls get a house in Cali?” Maybe he was dreaming for his potential girlfriend when he wrote the post, or maybe he was dedicating it to his current one.
