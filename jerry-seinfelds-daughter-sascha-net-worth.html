After all, some of the world's richest people set things up so their children get a lot of money once they reach a certain age.</p><p>Since Sascha Seinfeld isn't famous like her father, websites like Forbes and Celebrity Net Worth don't report on her.

As a result, it makes sense to assume that Jerry Seinfeld was telling the truth that he is rich and his kids aren't.</p><p>Based on that comment, <strong>Sascha Seinfeld likely isn't worth millions like her parents</strong>.</p><p>That said, it seems clear that Sascha Seinfeld has had some big financial advantages. For example, Sascha Seinfeld has a degree from Duke University and she almost certainly didn't have to go into debt to get it like many people do.
