Or Have The Pair Broken Up?</h1><div id=sub-header>July 2024 · 4 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p>Standing tall at 6’10”, <strong>Kevin Durant</strong> is arguably one of the best basketball players in the world and has been shining throughout his career. Winning two NBA Championships and two MVP awards, in 2017 and 2018 with Golden State Warrior, he has been proving his worth multiple times. But along with his burgeoning career as an unbeatable basketball player, he also has a reputation for failed relationships.</p><p>He was in a relationship with the beautifu<strong>l Cassandra Anderson</strong>. However, the former pair called it quits later on. Let’s shed a little light on KD’s relationship with his girlfriend, Cassandra Anderson.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Was_Kevin_Durants_Ex-Girlfriend_Cassandra_Anderson></span>Who Was Kevin Durant’s Ex-Girlfriend, Cassandra Anderson?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The NBA star, Kevin Durant’s ex-girlfriend, was no Instagram model but a real estate agent based in California. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">According to Heavy</a>, she is a good friend with Doc River’s daughter, Callie. They <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">played</a> volleyball together at the University of Florida’s volleyball team. Anderson was studying tourism and recreation at the time.</p><p>Durant’s ex-partner was a conversationalist and loved to build a personal relationship with her clients during her time in Berkshire Hathaway Drysdale Properties. She seemed to be an intelligent and supportive woman heading to the peak of her career.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kevin_Durants_First_Public_Relationship_After_His_Public_Break_Up_In_2014></span>Kevin Durant’s First Public Relationship After His Public Break Up In 2014<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kevin Durant’s ex-girlfriend, <strong>Cassandra Anderson,</strong> was a gorgeous lady and the first woman to be linked with KD since 2014. The world first got to reckon her in June 2018 when Durant decided to kiss her on the National television after winning Warrior’s second straight championship.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>VERY strange exchange between Kevin Durant and his girlfriend..? In the tunnel.. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/K4lKrqtu8g</a></p><p>— Nick Gray (@oklahomanick) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">June 9, 2018</a></p><p>The former couple had never acknowledged their relationship before June. However, Durant’s former sweetheart was spotted several times attending the Warrior games. Furthermore, she was also seen sitting in the wives and significant others section at games. The couple were linked together since mid-2017 and were very low-key. However, the couple did not last long.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Did_They_Separate></span>When Did They Separate?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The former couple were not seen since the kiss saga and then a pure drought. They were supposedly separated after the summer of 2018 and were moving on. Following the breakup, Cassandra’s Instagram was deleted after posting a few relationship-related memes.</p><p>Although nobody knows how serious they were with their relationship, the former couple was all about understanding one another. According to Sports Gossip, there were no marriage or baby talk, etc. Those two were living in the moment. However, no matter how perfect their relationship was, the couple did not last long and broke off at the end.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Durant_Was_Engaged_To_WNBA_Star_Monica_Wright></span>Durant Was Engaged To WNBA Star, Monica Wright<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before the relationship between Durant and Anderson became exclusive, he was almost ready to walk down the aisle with WNBA star, <strong>Monica Wright</strong>. The former couple called off their engagement in 2014. In an <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">interview with GQ</a>, he revealed that he had a fiancee but did not know how to love her right.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Monica-Wright.jpg><p>On the hind side, Kevin Durant’s ex-fiancee was open about her break up. According to Praise 107.9, it was her strong Christian beliefs that eventually pulled the now ex-couple apart. Thus, Wright’s relationship with her God and Durant’s lifestyle drifted them apart. But that could have been best for both of them since compatibility is crucial in a relationship.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Other_Women_Durant_Was_Linked_With></span>Other Women Durant Was Linked With<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Besides being in a relationship with Anderson and Wright, <a href=# rel="follow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Kevin Durant</a> was also linked with several women. In 2017, he supposedly dated former Bachelorette contestant, <strong>Rachel Lindsay</strong>. However, in an interview with the Bachelor Party podcast, she addressed the rumors and revealed that she and Kevin hung out together, but the media played it out. She mockingly recalls the media stretching their news as “serious” and “were almost engaged”.</p><p>Rachel further told when she attended Game 5 of NBA Finals in 2017; US<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> Magazine used the headline</a>, “Rachel Lindsay Watches Ex-Kevin Durant.” Hmm, Spicy!</p><p>Except for Rachel Lindsay, Durant made headlines when he was rumored to be dating <strong>Chris Brown</strong>‘s nanny, <strong>Amy Shehab</strong>. According to Sports Gossip, Durant slid in her DMs. Likewise, he was also connected with singers <strong>Crystal Renee</strong> and <strong>Jasmine Shine</strong>. Besides singers, he was also linked to former Warriors sideline reporter <strong>Rosalyn Gold-Onwude</strong>.</p><p>As of now, Durant is looking forward to making his comeback as he recovers from a ruptured Achilles sustained last June. Let’s hope all is well for the basketball wonder.</p><p>For more updates on&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Entertainment</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Celebrity Babies</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>YouTubers</strong></i></a>, and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Movies & TV Series</a></strong>&nbsp;follow&nbsp;<i><strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eCelebrityMirror</a>.</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBcLXSZpqaq6OWu6W%2BwGaYp5yVp8Cwuoysq6KknGK4psLIp2SdraKWu7V5xqKppZ6inrKvsIyoqWaaoqS4prqMrqdo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kenzy-wolfe-dylan-larkin-girlfriend.html>&#171;&nbsp;Kenzy Wolfe, Is She Still Dylan Larkins Girlfriend?</a>
