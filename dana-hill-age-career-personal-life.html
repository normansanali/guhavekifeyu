Her father Ted Goetz, a well-known film producer and director, was the one who first introduced her to the American film industry. He established himself in the TV commercial production industry during the course of his career.</span></p><p><span>Her mother, Sandy Goetz nee Hill, was a homemaker. Dana was the oldest of her parents’ three children. She had two younger brothers named, Mathew Goetz and Daniel Goetz.</span></p><p><span>She was one of four half-siblings born to her father’s first marriage to Jane Small: Beth, Jack, Amy, and Ted. Beth also passed away at an early age from problems brought on by diabetes.</span></p><p><span>Dana excelled at sports as a young girl. She excelled in swimming, basketball, and track during her elementary school years. She starred in her debut commercial in 1973, spinning a basketball on her finger alongside Boston Celtics player Dave William Cowens for a YMCA campaign. At the age of 10, she won the third nationwide position in the 880-yard run and fourth in the mile run.</span></p><p><span>She attended the now-defunct Van Nuys Cal Prep High School, where she received her diploma in 1981. She did a half-dozen TV advertisements, eight television shows, and frequently appeared in school plays.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Dana-Hill-1.webp alt="Dana Hill: Age, Career, Bio And More Of The Famous American Actress" width=900 height=750 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dana_Hills_Career></span><b>Dana Hill’s Career</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>At the age of 14, Dana Hill made her television debut in 1978, playing a girl scout in the ABC sitcom “Mork & Mindy” episode titled “Mork the Gullible.” Her father firmly advised against it and expressed his displeasure. She was, however, determined to keep performing.</span></p><p><span>Dana made two television appearances in 1979: she played Debbie in “The Paul Williams Show” and Courtney Featherstone in “Featherstone’s Nest.” In the same year, she also made an appearance as Maggie Joy in the television miniseries “The French Atlantic Affair.”</span></p><p><span>When she played the 12-year-old molestation victim Jennifer Phillips in the made-for-television film “Fallen Angel” in 1981, Dana earned her breakthrough. She was 17 at the time, but because of her diabetes, she appeared younger, and she ended up playing the part well. For it, she was given a Young Artist Award.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Dana-Hill-2.webp alt="Dana Hill: Age, Career, Bio And More Of The Famous American Actress" width=740 height=923 data-sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span>Dana Hill started to carve out a new path for herself as a voice actress starting in 1987. She began doing voiceover work for TV shows and films after she lost her ability to perform as an actor, including two episodes of ‘Pound Puppies’ in which she provided the voices of Toots and Colin.</span></p><p><span>“Timon & Pumbaa,” “What-a-Mess,” “The Hot Rod Dogs and Cool Car Cats,” “Adventures from the Book of Virtues,” and “The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper” were among her last works. When she fell into a diabetic coma in May 1996, her career came to an end.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dana_Hills_Death></span><b>Dana Hill’s Death</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Dana Hill, who had Type 1 diabetes from a very young age, died on July 15, 1996, in Burbank, California, in the United States.
