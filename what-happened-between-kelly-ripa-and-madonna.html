Ripa co-hosts the show with Ryan Seacrest. She previously hosted the show with Michael Strahan and Regis Philbin. Philbin was Ripa's co-host when she started appearing on the show. He previously hosted the show with Kathy Lee Gifford.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ripa brings a light-hearted quirkiness to her daytime television presence. One of the things many people who watch the show know about her is that she is a huge fan of <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>Madonna</a></strong>. Ripa's love for the Queen of Pop is expressed every time she is a guest on the show. It's also on full display whenever Ripa attends one of Madonna's concerts.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Madonna</a> has established herself as a pop music legend. Throughout her career, she has pushed boundaries and paved the way for every female artist that came after her. Artists like Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, and Miley Cyrus wouldn't be who they are without Madonna's influence. She made it possible for a woman to take charge of her sexuality in popular music. She has attracted a large legion of loyal fans around the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It should come as no surprise that Ripa is one of them.</p><h2 id=kelly-ripa-is-a-huge-madonna-fan>Kelly Ripa Is A Huge Madonna Fan</h2><p>Ripa has made no secret of her status as a huge Madonna fan. Ripa even received flowers and a note from Madonna when she was pregnant. It happened during the show and it was a surprise announcement that Madonna herself would be a future guest.</p><p>On Madonna's 63rd birthday, Ripa shared a photo of that very appearance. It took place in 2003 after Ripa's son Joaquin was born and Madonna was posing with the new baby.</p><p>In 2008, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Ripa told a story about her experience</a> at Madonna's "Sticky & Sweet Tour." Ripa talked about how she always wanted to be in the front row at a Madonna concert, but never expected it to happen. To her delight, this concert saw her seated front row.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Kelly Ripa Rejected A Strange Slimming Product Endorsement Deal While She Was Pregnant</a></span></p><p>She then talked about how Madonna came up to her during the last song. Madonna handed Ripa the microphone and asked her to sing part of the song. Ripa explained that this was always something she dreamed of, but never expected it to happen. She sang a bit of the song and handed the microphone back to Madonna.</p><h2 id=kelly-ripa-and-anderson-cooper-have-quite-the-experience-at-a-madonna-concert>Kelly Ripa And Anderson Cooper Have Quite The Experience At A Madonna Concert</h2><p>Ripa has been to a number of Madonna concerts over the years. It seems like every time Madonna goes on tour, Ripa makes sure to catch at least one of the shows.</p><p>In 2015, Madonna was on her "Rebel Heart World Tour." Ripa and Anderson Cooper went to the show at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. Ripa discussed her experience on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She described a point of the show where Madonna reached out her hand from the stage for Ripa. Kelly said that her husband joked that Madonna didn't anticipate that she wouldn't let go. Ripa said that Madonna did the same thing to Cooper as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Kelly Ripa Really Didn't Think She'd Be Attracted To Her Husband Mark Consuelos</a></span></p><p>She went on to say that Madonna's manager Guy Oseary approached Cooper during the show. Oseary asked Cooper if he would dance with Madonna on stage during one of the songs. Ripa said that a nervous Cooper asked her what to do, and Ripa proceeded to show him the dance routine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ripa went on to say that Madonna never knew who would be dancing with her on stage each night. The problem came when Cooper was unexpectedly stiff once he got on stage. When Madonna appeared on the show in 2017, she reflected on the experience.</p><p>According to Madonna, she had been out clubbing with Cooper before and was shocked at how uncomfortable he seemed. She said she always knew him to be a good dancer.</p><h2 id=kelly-fangirls-every-time-madonna-is-on-the-show>Kelly Fangirls Every Time Madonna Is On The Show</h2><p>Not surprisingly, Ripa has fangirled every time Madonna has appeared on the show.</p><p>The first time Madonna appeared on the show after Ripa was the official co-host was in 2003. <a href=# rel=nofollow>Madonna was promoting her "American Life" album</a> and Ripa could barely contain her excitement. She was beyond starstruck and Madonna even switched seats with Philbin in order to sit next to Ripa.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Madonna appeared on the show a second time that year to promote her first children's book, "The English Roses." This time, it wasn't just Ripa who did the fangirling. Pink, who was a musical guest on the same episode, <a href=# rel=nofollow>came out during Madonna's interview</a> to meet her.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Truth About Madonna's Relationship With Her Son David</a></span></p><p>Madonna appeared on the show at the end of 2006 and in early 2007. She had just adopted her son David from Malawi and wrapped her "Confessions Tour." Ripa, who attended one of the concerts, <a href=# rel=nofollow>raved about Madonna's performance</a>. Madonna even joked that RIpa was dancing so much that she lost her shoe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Madonna's most recent appearance on the show</a> came in 2017. She was there to promote her skin care line, MDNA Skin. During the appearance, Madonna played a game of charades with Ripa, Seacrest, and Cooper. Madonna and Ripa teased Cooper for how stiff he was on stage during Madonna's "Rebel Heart Tour."</p><p>One can surely expect that we will see many more moments between Ripa and Madonna in the future!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmo5Whubp50aKnmmWRo7FuucCdpqemkWQ%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-religion-does-larry-elder-follow-know-all-about-the-california-recall-candidate-amid-finances-probe.html>&#171;&nbsp;What Religion Does Larry Elder Follow?
