dissipated, it’s clear: <a href=#>Taylor Swift is dating Travis Kelce</a>, or at least doing something approximating it. After <a href=#>weeks of rumors and some goading from Kelce himself</a>, Swift appeared at the Kansas City Chiefs game against the Chicago Bears on September 24, sitting with Kelce’s mom, Donna, in a box. Swift then left the game with Kelce, and he <a href=#>reportedly</a> bought out a Kansas City restaurant (the Prime Social rooftop, definitely not a fake place) to hang out with her and the team afterward. They might have been “quietly hanging out” before, as <a href=#>The Messenger first reported</a>, but things are getting loud now.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln0ptbcs00e83g70fwjquqzt@published data-word-count=70>Dating an athlete is uncharted territory for Swift, who has previously stuck with actors and musicians. That means it’s also uncharted territory for Swifties, who probably haven’t thought this much about sports since Swift sang about dating high-school football players on Fearless. Conveniently, I’m not only a music writer but also a Chiefs fan. Let’s dig into what you need to know for this next chapter of Swift’s dating life.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Talk about being at the right place at the right time!

Son of Ed and Donna Kelce. Like Swift, he was born in 1989. (If you’re up for some numerology, his birthday is October 5 — the same day as Swift’s grandmother Marjorie.) He’s from Cleveland Heights, Ohio, which is just one state over from Pennsylvania — more of a hometown boy than a London boy. He went to college at the University of Cincinnati, where he played football and majored in exploratory studies (in other words, undecided). He was drafted by Kansas City in 2013 and has played for the team ever since. In 2016, he signed a $46 million contract extension and another $57 million one in 2020. He lives in the tony Briarcliff West neighborhood of Kansas City. His older brother, Jason — with whom Travis co-hosts a podcast called New Heights — plays for the Philadelphia Eagles, Swift’s own favorite team. The Chiefs beat them in the most recent Super Bowl, 38-35.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clmz0fup900343g70j5s6w4g0@published>What position does he play?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmz0f5st002m3g70gje1tpa5@published data-word-count=67>Kelce is a tight end — and no, that’s not just a <a href=#>dirty joke</a> he’s saving for Swift. Tight ends are versatile offensive players who can both block onrushing defenders and receive passes. In other words, during some plays, he’s one of the guys pushing defensive players away from his ball-carrying teammates; other times, he’s catching the ball and scoring touchdowns. Like this one, which Taylor enjoyed:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>TRAVIS KELCE TOUCHDOWN</p><p>TAYLOR SWIFT SAID “LET’S F—KING GO” <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/NYI4aRkEM7</a></p>— JPAFootball (@jasrifootball) <a href=#>September 24, 2023</a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmz40agi003v3g70trzxz7xm@published data-word-count=69>Kelce is exceedingly good at being a tight end. He’s already among the best players in the history of the position. He won two Super Bowls, he set the record for most receiving yards ever by a tight end (1,416, that’s a lot) in 2020, and earlier this season his peers ranked him the fifth-best player in the NFL. He’s downright Swift-like in being on top of his game.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clmz0du9n001w3g700xge8tbg@published>He sounds tall.</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmz0e4us002d3g70brpulrpt@published data-word-count=9>Yeah, he’s 6-foot-5 — <a href=#>same height as Calvin Harris</a>.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clmzdpjmu007p3g70wy5lhw7s@published>What’s he like off the field?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmzdwmst00933g7015ju08nj@published data-word-count=139>He’s got a reputation as a work-hard, <a href=#>play-hard</a> kind of guy. (It’s a tight-end thing. <a href=#>Remember Gronk</a>? Gronk was a tight end.) He has been in the tabloids for his share of <a href=#>partying</a>, but he also loves a nice round of <a href=#>golf</a>. As Swifties have already figured out, he has <a href=#>his own sense of style</a> and he appreciates music — he made the Beastie Boys’ “(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (to Party!)” his theme song, and he put on a music festival with Machine Gun Kelly and Rick Ross. But arguably his best quality is his sense of humor. When he hosted Saturday Night Live earlier this year, he played a lovable oaf of a <a href=#>Straight Male Friend</a>, a weird as hell <a href=#>American Girl doll collector</a>, and <a href=#>a trainer</a> putting a beating on the Please Don’t Destroy guys.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clmzev5qd009b3g70a2vj7ahj@published>Whom has he dated before Taylor Swift?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln0hj3kt00by3g70f24cgweu@published data-word-count=91>Technically, over 50 women. Back in 2016, Kelce starred in <a href=#>Catching Kelce</a>, a dating show for E! in which one contestant from each state vied for his heart. In the end, he chose Kentucky’s Maya Benberry, but they were together for only a few months. More recently, Kelce dated Kayla Nicole, a sports reporter and influencer. They were together off and on since 2017, most recently splitting in May of last year. (Rumors swirled after their splits that Kelce was a cheater or a cheapskate; he has <a href=#>denied</a> <a href=#>all</a> of it.)</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clmz4dz8i004m3g7057g5empy@published>Wait, does he have any other controversies?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln0mi37b00c63g70qlie22rw@published data-word-count=24>Not really!

(Watch the Netflix series Quarterback for more on him.) Following Sunday’s game, Mahomes, a two-time NFL MVP, said he “felt a bit of pressure” to throw a touchdown pass to Kelce once he knew Swift was in attendance. <a href=#>He’s Kelce’s work bestie</a>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmz538b4005f3g7070nu8h14@published data-word-count=67>There’s also Andy Reid, the Chiefs’ head coach. Before he got to Kansas City in 2013, he coached the Eagles from 1999 to 2012. (<a href=#>Remember, you know the Eagles</a>.) He became the fourth-most-winning NFL coach of all time after that September 24 game. He really has met the Swift family, but as good of a coach as he is, he probably didn’t <a href=#>set up</a> Kelce and Swift.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clmz57w6j005z3g70pl9265nz@published>Sidebar: It’s 2023 and they’re still called the Chiefs?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmz57t3l005p3g709uypnuoi@published data-word-count=70>The football team in Washington, D.C., now known as the Commanders might have <a href=#>ditched its racist name</a> in 2020, but Kansas City is still holding on for dear life. The Chiefs have long <a href=#>claimed</a> the name honors Native Americans, but Native American groups <a href=#>continue to say</a>, no, it’s offensive. The team leans into it with an array of questionable choices during games, including a drum-beating ceremony and a <a href=#>tomahawk-chop</a> celebration.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clmzbxiqg006k3g70ko0ip4ly@published>Will Kelce reach the Super Bowl again this season?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmzcv5d9006u3g703tcp1vhz@published data-word-count=69>Check back in January. It may feel as if you’ve been hearing about these relationship rumors for months, but we’re only a few weeks into the NFL season. The Chiefs are almost certainly going to make the playoffs, but they have stiff competition from other teams in their conference such as the Miami Dolphins, Buffalo Bills, and Baltimore Ravens. None of them will have Swift on their side, though.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clmzd0jn900743g70d5mrqkio@published>And will they play the Eagles again?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmzd0ssw007e3g70lo01w6bg@published data-word-count=51>Mark your calendars because the Chiefs face the birds on November 20 in a Super Bowl rematch.

The table couldn’t be better set for a prime-time Swift spotting. (Call it “Welcome to New York (Taylor’s Version)” promo.) Unluckily for you and everyone else, the Jets are one of the <a href=#>most rudderless</a> teams in football right now.
