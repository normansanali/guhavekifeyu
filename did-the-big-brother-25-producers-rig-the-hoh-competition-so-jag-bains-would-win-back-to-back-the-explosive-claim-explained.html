Brother, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jag has officially been named the Head of Household for the second week in a row</a> after placing first in the Dental Charts challenge, and fans are not thrilled (to say the least). Per the typical rules of Big Brother, given that he was the HoH last week, he shouldn’t have been allowed to compete in the first place!</p><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=801 data-injectable=true>The reason Jag was able to participate in back-to-back HoH competitions was because last week he was the “Invisible HoH” as a special “Comic-Verse” twist. Participating in the classic competition Big Brother superfans know and love, BB Comics, the individual who completed the puzzle in the fastest amount of time was secretly crowned the Head of Household by production, which came with some extra superpowers.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>As the “Invisible HoH,” Jag was able to name nominees (as well as replacement nominees) in private, vote during the live eviction on October 19, and of course, compete in the HoH competition that was to follow.</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=512 data-injectable=true>Not only was Jag able to try his luck at being the Head of Household this week, which viewers have deemed to be unfair, but the nature of the Dental Charts challenge itself has posed some red flags. Did the Big Brother 25 producers play to Jag’s strengths just so he would win again?</p><p data-characters=71 data-current-count=71 data-injectable=false>Keep scrolling for more information about this intriguing theory…</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=true>For those who are unfamiliar with the Head of Household competition for week 11, BB Comics, it requires competitors to climb a ladder and take a zipline, all while peeking into a window to study comic book covers of their fellow houseguests.</p><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=211 data-injectable=false>Depicting the Big Brother 25 houseguests as superheroes and supervillains, all while incorporating aspects of their personality or journey on the beloved competition series thus far, the comics were as followed:</p><ul data-items-injection=true data-current-count=994.5 data-injectable=true><li>Bowie Jane as the Bowie-Rang</li><li>Cameron Hardin as the Hair Raiser</li><li>Cirie Fields as Robe-Bot</li><li>Jag Bains as Cock-a-Doodle Zoom</li><li>America Lopez as Night-Merica</li><li data-injectable=true>Cory Wurtenberger as Alba-Cory</li><li>Blue Kim as Kitty Kitty Purr</li><li>Matt Klotz as Pool-Tergesit</li><li>Felicia Cannon as Kayak Attack</li><li>Jared Fields as Muffin Hands</li><li>Mecole Hayes as Mecolamity</li><li>Red Utley as the Chill-Billy</li><li>Izzy Gleicher as Dizzy Izzy</li><li>Hisam Goueli as Ha-Ha Hisam</li><li>Reilly Smedley as Nashvillain</li><li>Kirsten Elwin as Curse-Sten</li></ul><p data-characters=206 data-current-count=206 data-injectable=false>Once they’re back on the ground, the houseguests must decipher which comics are the ones they saw through the window.

After memorizing which teeth were chipped, cracked, and/or missing altogether from the skulls, the competitors had to match each skull to its corresponding dental chart.</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=621 data-injectable=true>In true Big Brother fashion, there were a total 24 charts, with each one representing a previous Big Brother winner. Given that only five charts were needed, a majority of these were fake, featuring slight variations that were meant mix the houseguests up — sound familiar?</p><p data-characters=124 data-current-count=124 data-injectable=false>As we know, Jag won the HoH competition for the second time in a row, so perhaps these types of challenges are up his alley!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=424 data-injectable=true>https://www.reddit.com/r/BigBrother/comments/17falgi/the_last_two_hoh_competitions_were_the_same_game/</figure><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>Because of the similarities between the BB Comics and Dental Charts challenges, as well as the fact that they resulted in the same champion, Big Brother superfans took to Reddit to accuse the Big Brother 25 producers of rigging the competition in favor of Jag Bains.</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true>“BB Comics and Dental Charts were different versions of the same game: Do something physical, remember something/spot the differences, place cards. While a fun watch, it’s no surprise the same person won both,” @lilac_wren dished, kicking off the conversation.</p><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=144 data-injectable=false>Another shared, “Yeah I noticed that too… was like ‘Huh… How is this fundamentally any different than BB Comics?'”</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>Rather than focusing on the similarities between BB Comics and Dental Charts, some Big Brother superfans were hung up on the fact that Jag shouldn’t have been able to play in the first place.</p><p data-characters=564 data-current-count=906 data-injectable=true>@fireflysz spilled, “It doesn’t even matter if they were the same game. Jag should have never been allowed to play again in the first place. I really do not understand how Claire was asked to throw the following HoH competition after she overtook Tiffany’s HoH in Big Brother 23, while Jag wasn’t. Jag had final say over his nominations, even though there were two vetos in play. To me, if you have final say over your nominations and there was no quitter/battleback, you shouldn’t be allowed to play in the following HoH comp.”</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>“The comments are focusing on the wrong things. It’s less of an argument that it was physical or not equitable. It’s more of two things: 1. It was the exact same skillset as the prior HoH, which is just lazy. 2. Jag shouldn’t have been playing in the first place tbh,” shared another.</p><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true>Do you think that production got involved so Jag would garner back-to-back victories, or do you think the truck company owner won the Head of Household competition fair and square?</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=198 data-injectable=false>Nonetheless, Tune into CBS and/or Paramount Plus for new episodes of&nbsp;Big Brother&nbsp;every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday. With seven houseguests remaining, the season is starting to wind down!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yltcNmq6GdXZe2qHnBq6atoJWnenOBjKmpqJylmLKzv4yroKBlpJ2ybrTOoWScp52lsrW106Kmp2WjpHqrrcZmmZqhnqh6uLvUpZtmr5mjeqOtwqRkraddl66kt4ytn55lla29rbvSoq2eZZOhrqq5jJ6vqaSRnrumsI4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-was-matthew-perry-related-to-datelines-keith-morrison.html>&#171;&nbsp;How was Matthew Perry related to Datelines Keith Morrison?</a>
