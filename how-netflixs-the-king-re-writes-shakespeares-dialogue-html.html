confidence would do well to study the example of Joel Edgerton and David Michôd. For their Henry V film <a href=#>The King</a>, currently <a href=#>streaming on Netflix</a>, the pair borrowed most of the plot, characters, and big moments from Shakespeare’s trio of plays about the monarch, but chose to jettison the Bard’s famous verse in favor of dialogue of their own creation. Edgerton and Michôd aren’t the first to rewrite Shakespeare — millennials will recall 10 Things I Hate About You kicked off a wave of adaptations that brought Shakespearean plots to American high schools, efforts that were generally more successful with comedies (She’s the Man) than tragedies (O). There the change in scenery freed filmmakers from the burden of direct adaptation; in keeping so much the same, the people behind The King have made each departure feel even more glaring. Besides the language, they’ve also changed the fates of a few supporting players, and given the story new themes. Timothée Chalamet’s Hal is now a noble pacifist who disdains war and imperialism, which is kind of like turning Romeo into an incel.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2ne46eu001u3a684eq8s0ry@published data-word-count=67>Instead of iambic pentameter, characters in The King speak in what we might call Game of Thrones English, a blend of short staccato sentences, stentorian pronouncements, a few old-timey phrasings, and frequent cursing. How does it compare to the original? We’ve taken excerpts from a few scenes that directly line up with Shakespeare’s own, to see.

After putting down an army of Scottish rebels, Hotspur has taken prisoners, and won’t transfer them to the crown unless Henry IV ransoms his relative, Mortimer, from the Welsh rebel Owen Glendower. The older Henry believes Mortimer is secretly in league with the Welsh, and demands young Hotspur give him the prisoners at once. Here’s how it goes down in Act I, Scene 3 (condensed slightly for length):</p><p>HENRY IV</p><p>Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,&nbsp;</p><p>But with proviso and exception,&nbsp;</p><p>That we at our own charge shall ransom straight&nbsp;</p><p>His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer</p><p>[…]</p><p>Shall our coffers, then,&nbsp;</p><p>Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?&nbsp;</p><p>Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,&nbsp;</p><p>When they have lost and forfeited themselves?&nbsp;</p><p>No, on the barren mountains let him starve;&nbsp;</p><p>For I shall never hold that man my friend&nbsp;</p><p>Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost&nbsp;</p><p>To ransom home revolted Mortimer.</p><p><br></p><p>HOTSPUR</p><p>Revolted Mortimer!&nbsp;</p><p>He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,&nbsp;</p><p>But by the chance of war; to prove that true&nbsp;</p><p>Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,&nbsp;</p><p>Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took&nbsp;</p><p>When on the gentle Severn’s sedgy bank,&nbsp;</p><p>In single opposition, hand to hand,&nbsp;</p><p>He did confound the best part of an hour&nbsp;</p><p>In changing hardiment with great Glendower…</p><p><br></p><p>HENRY IV</p><p>Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;</p><p>He never did encounter with Glendower:</p><p>I tell thee,</p><p>He durst as well have met the devil alone</p><p>As Owen Glendower for an enemy.</p><p>Art thou not ashamed?

I rather believe Mortimer a traitor. He has joined the Welsh rebels. He has betrayed England, and is now an enemy of mine, and therefore of yours. You agree with my précis, young Hotspur?</p><p><br></p><p>HOTSPUR</p><p>No, your grace. I believe yours to be the ramblings of a crazy old demon. Yours are the ramblings of an old man so saturated with malice and mistrust that he no longer knows up from down, can no longer see beyond the walls of his own monstrous schloss. My family have served you. We aided you in your ascension and still we fight for you. Cousin Mortimer has fought for you.

But I’ve seen one eke enough wing-flap to clear a fence. Then it’s free. But then so too are the foxes. You are right, young Percy, I owe you much. I owe your family still more. But if the Scottish traitors you’ve taken prisoner are not brought to me as speedily as they might travel, I will hang you by your fucking neck. Has this been heard, young Percy?</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck2ne80vq002t3a68wxb9k5m2@published>Hotspur fights Prince Hal</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2ne8c4x002z3a68nqk6cuv0@published data-word-count=90>Hotspur, what a character! His death forms the climax of Henry IV, Part I, but in The King it comes only a few scenes in. In both cases, he perishes at the hands of the future Henry V, whose dose of battlefield glory signifies his evolution from drunken young wastrel to capable ruler. In Shakespeare, the fight scene takes place in Act V, Scene 4, as the two men find each other on the battlefield at Shrewsbury and get into a bit of a debate over their shared first name:</p><p>HOTSPUR</p><p>If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.</p><p><br></p><p>HENRY V</p><p>Thou speak’st as if I would deny my name.</p><p><br></p><p>HOTSPUR</p><p>My name is Harry Percy.</p><p><br></p><p>HENRY V</p><p>Why, then I see</p><p>A very valiant rebel of the name.</p><p>I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,</p><p>To share with me in glory any more:</p><p>Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere;</p><p>Nor can one England brook a double reign,</p><p>Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.</p><p><br></p><p>HOTSPUR</p><p>Nor shall it, Harry; for the hour is come</p><p>To end the one of us; and would to God</p><p>Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!</p><p><br></p><p>[…]</p><p><br></p><p>[They fight.]</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2ne9a6u003b3a689y0mgbyi@published data-word-count=33>In The King, a battle is about to begin, but Prince Henry proposes a duel instead, as a way to save the lives of the other men in both armies.

Despite killing Hotspur and proving himself a real man, Prince Henry’s relationship with the king hasn’t gotten much better. But when he hears his father is close to death, he decides to pay the man one final visit. In Act IV, Scene 3, he sees the dying king and monologues about embracing his new destiny:</p><p>HENRY V</p><p>Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow,</p><p>Being so troublesome a bedfellow?</p><p>O polish’d perturbation! golden care!</p><p>That keep’st the ports of slumber open wide</p><p>To many a watchful night!

O majesty!</p><p>When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit</p><p>Like a rich armour worn in heat of day</p><p>That scald’st with safety.

Thy due from me</p><p>Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood</p><p>Which nature, love, and filial tenderness,</p><p>Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously.</p><p>My due from thee is this imperial crown,</p><p>Which, as immediate from thy place and blood,</p><p>Derives itself to me.

In The King, that moment is much shorter, and slightly different:</p><p>[Enter Henry V]</p><p><br></p><p>HENRY V</p><p>You feel this cold? Wrench.</p><p><br></p><p>[He tears the sheets from his father’s bed.]</p><p><br></p><p>HENRY IV</p><p>Hal. Hal. You must be king.

Here’s the flowery speech he gives them in Act V, Scene 2 of Henry IV Part 2:</p><p>HENRY V</p><p>This new and gorgeous garment, majesty,</p><p>Sits not so easy on me as you think.</p><p>Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear.</p><p>This is the English, not the Turkish court;</p><p>Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,</p><p>But Harry Harry.

Its version of the above monologue comes roughly 30 seconds after Henry has stormed into the king’s bedchamber.</p><p>HENRY V</p><p>You know not what will become of you. So, I offer you this. The most blessed reprieve. The most dreadful misery. You shall suffer the indignity of serving me, the wayward son you so revile.

In Henry V, the young king immediately takes it as a challenge, and vows to cross the Channel and press his claim to the French throne. Here’s his speech from Act I, Scene 2 (again, slightly condensed):</p><p>HENRY V</p><p>We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;&nbsp;</p><p>His present and your pains we thank you for:&nbsp;</p><p>When we have march’d our rackets to these balls,&nbsp;</p><p>We will, in France, by God’s grace, play a set&nbsp;</p><p>Shall strike his father’s crown into the hazard.&nbsp;</p><p>Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler&nbsp;</p><p>That all the courts of France will be disturb’d&nbsp;</p><p>With chaces.

Both stories also have to shoehorn in the Southampton Plot, where a few of Henry’s advisers plotted to put his distant relative on the throne, got found out, and were executed shortly before the king set sail. In the play, Henry tricks the advisers into pressing for a harsh sentence against those who have spoken out against the king, then presents them with letters proving their guilt. Having just argued against mercy, the men can’t demand it for themselves:</p><p>HENRY V</p><p>And now to our French causes:</p><p>Who are the late commissioners?</p><p><br></p><p>EARL OF CAMBRIDGE</p><p>I one, my lord:</p><p>Your highness bade me ask for it to-day.</p><p><br></p><p>LORD SCROOP</p><p>So did you me, my liege.</p><p><br></p><p>SIR THOMAS GREY</p><p>And I, my royal sovereign.</p><p><br></p><p>HENRY V</p><p>Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours;</p><p>There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham; and, sir knight,</p><p>Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:</p><p>Read them; and know, I know your worthiness.</p><p>My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter,</p><p>We will aboard to night.

Edgerton and Michôd dispense with the letter shenanigans and get straight to the point:</p><p>HENRY V</p><p>As of today, we are at war with France. Twice I have given her the benefit of my doubt. This third affront will not be left unchecked. And so, in order to flush these French rats from their nests, I will have it communicated to them that we are now at war.

With The King skipping the battle at Harfleur that gives us the “Once more unto the breach” speech, Henry’s famous pre-battle monologue at Agincourt is the filmmakers’ big chance to put their own spin on Shakespeare’s most stirring language. If you’ve forgotten it, here it is (in full), from Act IV, Scene 3:</p><p>EARL OF WESTMORELAND&nbsp;</p><p>O that we now had here</p><p>But one ten thousand of those men in England</p><p>That do no work to-day!</p><p><br></p><p>HENRY V</p><p>What’s he that wishes so?</p><p>My cousin Westmoreland?

It is the same one I’d give were we not standing on the brim of a battlefield. It is the same one I’d give were we to meet in the street by chance. I have only ever hoped for one thing: to see this kingdom united under this English crown. All men are born to die. We know it. We carry it with us always. If your day be today, so be it. Mine will be tomorrow. Or mine today and yours tomorrow. It matters not. What matters is that you know in your hearts that today you are that kingdom united. You are England, each and every one of you. England is you. And it is the space between you. Fight not for yourselves. Fight for that space. Fill that space. Make it tissue. Make it mass. Make it impenetrable. Make it yours! Make it England! Make it England! Great men to it, captains, lords.

Except … she doesn’t speak English! What is a horny king to do, except try to woo her anyway, with the assistance of Alice, a lady-in-waiting. Here’s a portion of their exchange from Act V, Scene 2:</p><p>HENRY V</p><p>Fair Katharine, and most fair,</p><p>Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms</p><p>Such as will enter at a lady’s ear</p><p>And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?</p><p><br></p><p>KATHARINE</p><p>Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.</p><p><br></p><p>HENRY V</p><p>O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you&nbsp;confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?</p><p><br></p><p>KATHARINE</p><p>Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is ‘like me.’</p><p><br></p><p>HENRY V</p><p>An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.</p><p><br></p><p>KATHARINE</p><p>Que dit-il? que je suis semblable a les anges?

I’ faith, Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I am glad thou canst speak no better English; for, if thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but directly to say ‘I love you:’ then if you urge me farther than to say ‘do you in faith?’ I wear out my suit. Give me your answer; i’ faith, do: and so clap hands and a bargain: how say you, lady?</p><p><br></p><p>KATHARINE</p><p>Sauf votre honneur, me understand vell.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2nexk32008s3a6819e3s65p@published data-word-count=77>The scene in the play goes on for quite some time after that, but I’ll spare you more blocks of text. The King, funnily enough, treats Henry and Katharine’s little language games with a lot more reverence than it does the rest of Henry V, but it also throws in a twist! Katharine is not just a very progressive 15th-century noblewoman who believes “all monarchy is illegitimate,” she also helps Henry wake up to the real enemy:</p><p>KATHARINE</p><p>[In French] Please sit, your majesty.</p><p><br></p><p>HENRY V</p><p>[In French] You are beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>KATHARINE</p><p>Merci.</p><p><br></p><p>HENRY V</p><p>[In French] I will no longer speak French.

While this twist bears heavy similarities to <a href=#>actual medieval propaganda</a>, I suspect the filmmakers’ intent had more to do with drama than history. As the movie’s Falstaff, having evaded the fate Shakespeare gave him,&nbsp;says on the eve of Agincourt: “Either I die here, or I die over a bottle in Eastcheap. I think this makes for a much better story.” I’ll leave it up to you to decide whether that’s true or not.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>How The King Rewrites Shakespeare’s Most Famous Dialogue</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlocmdhZnypu9ZmpZ6slqG2ub%2BMrZ%2BeZZueu6h50Z5ksKqZqbK0edKhmKSdo6Wyor7ErGSdoZGhvKjBxGefraWc</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jan-uddin-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-151248-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jan Uddin Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a>
