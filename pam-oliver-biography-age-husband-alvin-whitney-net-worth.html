teams, is one of those women who is exceptionally good at what she does.&nbsp;The journalist’s career has spanned over 3 decades during which she has worked with various media houses in the industry.</span></p><p><span>Apart from everything you already know about Pam, we are going to tell you a lot more here starting with her background, career, marital life and all the other facts we were able to gather about the sports journalist.&nbsp;So read on as we bring you the life events of Alvin Whitney’s wife.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Pam Oliver – Biography (Age)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Pamela Donielle Oliver (Pam Oliver) was born on March 10, 1961 in Yeat in Dallas, Texas to a family where her father was a member of the United States Air Force.&nbsp;As the nature of his father’s work required, the Olivers moved around the United States extensively, having their homes in various places and at different times.&nbsp;They have lived in Texas, Michigan, Washington, California and Florida, among others.</span></p><p><span>Growing up, Pamela was an exception to a typical child and a girl in particular.&nbsp;When her peers were engrossed in children’s shows on television, she spent her time watching one sporting event or the other.&nbsp;Thus, she began to prepare for acquaintance with sports for a very long time.&nbsp;Donielle attended Niceville High School, a public high school in the city of Niceville, Florida.&nbsp;In school, she competed and excelled in sports like basketball, tennis as well as track and field events.&nbsp;With her exception in high school sports, she earned a sports scholarship to Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University where she studied broadcast journalism.</span></p><p><span>Pam Oliver never gave in to her pursuit of sporting interest, she dominated the tracks emerging as a college All-American in the mile relay and 400 meter races.&nbsp;For everything that has a beginning, there must certainly be an end;&nbsp;Pam’s time at Florida A&M University ended in 1984 when she earned a degree in broadcast journalism.&nbsp;She was later inducted into the Florida A&M Hall of Fame in 1996 in recognition of her countless contributions and accomplishments in sports while in college.&nbsp;After graduating, Donielle dove into her media career and hasn’t backed down since.</span></p><p><span>She got her first job in 1985 at WALB in Albany, Georgia as a reporter for the NBC/ABC affiliate television station.&nbsp;Her first job, however, turned out to be one she wouldn’t be in for very long as she moved to Huntsville, Alabama to start working with WAAY-TV in 1986. From this ABC-affiliated television station, the sports enthusiast moved to WIVB-TV in Buffalo, New York in 1988 before joining WTVT in Tampa, Florida in 1990. It was at the Fox-owned and operated television station – WTVT that her interest in sports and journalism training was merged..&nbsp;She began working as a sports presenter in 1991. Pam Oliver continued in that same role when she joined KHOU-TV in Houston.</span></p><p><span>In 1993, she entered another phase of her career as she was hired by industry giants.&nbsp;First, ESPN and Fox Sports 2 years later.&nbsp;In the latter, Pam Oliver worked alongside John Madden and Pat Summerall (the network’s number one broadcast team) as a sideline reporter.&nbsp;In addition to this, Pam has also worked as an anchor on two of the network’s shows –&nbsp;</span><span>Southern Sports Tonight</span><span>&nbsp;and Southern Sports&nbsp;</span><span>Report</span><span>.&nbsp;Her time at Fox Sports was remarkable with her reporting on the NBA playoffs, interviews with many industry players, and creating many feature film programs focusing on many sports people.</span></p><p><span>She joined TNT as a sideline reporter in the year 2005 for NBA coverage.&nbsp;Her final season in the NFL as a sideline reporter was in 2014 when she joined the network’s NFL broadcast team.&nbsp;She stayed with the team until 2018 and is undoubtedly still a big name in sports journalism.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>With a career that has spanned over 3 decades, Pam Oliver has certainly seen good days in her career off and on the pitch.&nbsp;Monetarily, she earns an annual salary of around $1 million while her net worth is estimated to be around $4 million.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Her Husband – Alvin Whitney</span></strong></h2><p><span>Just like her career, Pam Oliver also had and still has a happy married life.&nbsp;She married the love of her life and her longtime boyfriend Alvin Whitney (an independent producer) in 1990. The duo have been together since then with no negative rumors doing the rounds about their marriage.</span></p><p><span>Although the couple have been married for a very long time, there has been no news that they have a biological or adopted child.&nbsp;Either way, their union was one of the strongest in the celebrity circle.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiokaJ6sLjIr5yrZZKevKi%2BwKmfsmWRnLJutNSsmZqmlGKurcLIp2SwoJmpu6bFjKecrWWnpL%2B1tI4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./boxing-news-rolly-romero-vs-ismael-barroso-stats-record-reach-height-age-and-knockout-ratio.html>&#171;&nbsp;Rolly Romero vs Ismael Barroso Stats: Record, Reach, Height, Age, and Knockout Ratio</a>
